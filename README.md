# Lexical Simplification 

This is a system developed for lexical simplification based on the paper by [Gooding and Kochmar (2019)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1491.pdf).

Given a sentence the system will identify complex words and recursively simplify the lexical content in a context-aware manner.
