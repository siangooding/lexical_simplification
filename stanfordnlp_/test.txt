The Seattle-based company has applied for its brand to be a top-level domain name ( currently .com ) , but the South American governments argue this would prevent the use of this internet address for environmental protection , the promotion of indigenous rights and other public interest uses .
Until now , the differences between commercial , governmental and other types of identity were easily distinguished in every internet address by .com , .gov and 20 other categories .
Amazon has applied for dozens of new domains , including .shop , .song , .book and .kindle .
Allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to reinforce their brand strategy or to profit from the meaning of these names does not serve , in our view , the public interest , the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said .
Brazil said its views were endorsed last month by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty ( Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Guyana , Suriname and Venezuela ) .
Argentina has lodged an expression of its unhappiness that the US outdoor clothing retailer , Patagonia , is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament .
Argentina rejects the .patagonia request for a new generic top-level domain , the government notes in an appeal .
Patagonia is a relevant region for the countrys economy because it has oil , fishing , mining and agriculture resources .
But Bartho Boer , a spokesman for the Mayor , denies that the plans are illiberal .
We want everyone to be who he and she is whether they are gay and lesbian or stand up to violence and are then victims of harassment .
We as a society want to defend them .
