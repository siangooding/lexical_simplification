Teffs tiny seeds  the size of poppy seeds  are high in calcium, iron and protein, and also amino acids.
It says that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes, and help reduce malnutrition  particularly among children.
Mama Fresh is a family company that sells injera to top restaurants and hotels in the Ethiopian capital.
But the company wants to double exports to America in 2014 and will soon start producing teff-based pizzas, bread and cookies.
There is not much Ethiopian teff on the international market, so farmers in the US have started planting the crop.
But the president made clear that he did not expect another serious budget fight and shutdown in 2014.

The report says that injuries are often the first opportunity to discover violence in the home and to offer the woman help.
Violence has a big effect on womens health.
For the first time we have compared data from all over the world on partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the effect of these sorts of violence on health, said Garcia-Moreno.
If a woman comes back several times with injuries she doesnt mention, you should ask her about domestic violence, said Garcia-Moreno.   
But, on Tuesday April 8th, 2014, she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he threw it into the Baltic Sea.
It was very surprising, Erdmann, 62, said, when she described how she found out about the bottle.
Holger von Neuhoff, a curator at the museum, said this bottled message was the oldest he had ever seen.
Researchers believe that Erdmanns grandfather, Richard Platz, threw the bottle into the sea when he was on a hike in 1913.
Erdmann said she also liked culture and travelling around the world, just like her grandfather.
Sleep was for wimps.
Luxury hotels give people sleep retreats; more than $1,000 gets you dinner and a movie about sleep.

But, for the small Muslim community of Iqaluit, life in the land of the midnight sun is a real challenge during the month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset.
This follows the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city.
They still have to fast for around 18 hours a day, said Atif Jilani, who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto.
In recent years, much of the community has chosen to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton, in Alberta.
Some follow the timetable of Mecca, for example Awan, a father of two young children, including a 12-year-old who recently started fasting.
If I fast Edmonton times, my son might say, Papa, you are really insane.
For the 100 Muslims in Inuvik, a small town 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle, it is impossible to follow the local movements of the sun.
In Inuvik, where most of the population is Inuit, the Muslim community has tried to find a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions.
Its particularly true for people like Karim who have followed the local sunrise and sunset carefully.
People without qualifications who want to use MOOCs as a bridge to higher education?
This may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without high-level qualifications, but it suggests that MOOCs could be a really good tool for continuing education, he added.
The real challenge is to allow those countries not just to study MOOCs, but also to create them.

Guillaume Chapron from Swedens University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across Europe found wolves living in suburban areas with up to 3,050 people per square kilometre.
Most important, said Chapron, is the EU Habitats Directive, which has forced member states to protect and revive rare species.
If it works in the rest of Europe, theres absolutely no reason why it cant work in the UK, he said.
Theres no reason why we cant have a similar return of wildlife in the UK.

When Larry Pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: Why would anyone want to spoil a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?
Electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which use motors; you pedal an electric bike with  or without  help from an electric motor.
Perhaps most importantly, more cities are building bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular.

One key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 European citizens each year is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars  this causes much more pollution on the road, said Greg Archer, the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment.
According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg per kilometre standard and some cars are 22 times above the recommended limit.
Real Driving Emissions is a totally new regulation that will force significant changes, said Cara McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA).
By 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests should begin.

In 2012, scientists chose the formal name flerovium for element 114, after the Flerov Lab at Dubnas Joint Institute of Research.
The Japanese team is considering three names for element 113: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, where they found the element.
If we understand it better, hopefully we can find a better way to deal with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world.
Scientists must find new names for the elements but, also, they must suggest two-letter symbols for the elements.
In 1996, someone suggested the symbol Cp for copernicium, or element 112, but it was changed to Cn, when scientists complained that Cp was already the symbol for another substance.
To discover the elements, researchers at the three labs crashed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for the radioactive decays that should come from the new elements.
There is currently 150 million tonnes of plastic rubbish around the planet and oceans, poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife.

Benjamin Carle is 96.9% made in France, even his underpants and socks.
Carle, 26, decided, in 2013, to see if it was possible to live using only French-made products for ten months as part of a television documentary.
For the experiment, Carle had to give up his smartphone, television, refrigerator (all made in China); his glasses (Italian); his morning coffee (Guatemalan) and his favourite David Bowie music (British).
His foreign-made clothes, including his underwear, were replaced with more expensive alternatives: French-produced underpants (26), socks (9), polo shirt (75), espadrille sandals (26), but no jeans because none are produced in France.

As temperatures rise and oceans become warmer, there will be big changes in annual rainfall in tropical and subtropical regions, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released in Stockholm and published online in September 2013.
East Africa can expect more short rainfalls and west Africa should expect heavier monsoons.
The IPCC says that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before.
They do not need the IPCC to tell them that the weather is changing, said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development.
A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, went to another level-5 match to check another young referee  John Brooks.
A little later, the football club secretary arrived to pay the officials for their time  the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is clear that these men do not do it for the money.
Riley, as a young referee, bought himself books on psychology and nutrition because there was no information on offer to him at all.

It is possible that we could use this technology to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking, said Alexander Huth, the main author of the study.
Each person heard about 25,000 words  and more than 3,000 different words  as they lay in the scanner.
The atlas shows how words and related terms use the same regions of the brain.
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have many meanings.
One part of the brain, for example, is used for the word top and also for other words that describe clothes.
If they force people outside the bar to smoke, it is going to increase the tension thats already there.
I couldnt ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city, says Douville.
But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity.
There are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days  now, those people can come.
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well, she says.
We can have clean air without noise problems  I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.
Bar customers must  ll out a form or call 311 and include photographs of illegal smoking.

The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world  more than ever before  which examine differences between organic and regular fruit, vegetables and cereals.
Another criticism of the research is that the differences it found may be the result of different climates, different types of soil and different types of crops; they may not be the result of organic farming.
Browning said: This research supports what people think about organic food.
In other countries, there is much more support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming.

The results showed that a childs month of birth could make big differences to their levels of  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport.
The gap in physical ability between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide.
Children that get a high-quality  rst experience will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and be good at sport as they grow up, he said.
As soon as the children at a primary school in Stirling, Scotland, hear the words daily mile, they leave the classroom and start running around the school  eld.
For three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at St Ninians Primary School have walked or run a mile each day.
Just in Stirling, 30 schools have already started or are going to start the daily mile.
Researchers from Stirling University have begun a study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile.
Paralympian, Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of ukactive, a health organization for physical activity, said: All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day  this can be in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground.
The Scottish government also supports the idea.
His team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on a train carriage and bacteria that cause plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan.
All around the subway, there were bacteria from cheeses  brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella found on New York pizza.
The bacteria of Swiss cheese were found in midtown Manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to make kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and Bay Ridge.
Bacteria that cause diarrhoea and nausea, as well as E.coli, and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city.
He said he hoped the research would help health of cials to prevent and track diseases.

Stratford was important to Shakespeare all his life, says Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be celebrated across Britain and the world.
In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to show each of Shakespeares plays.
The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and almost every other theatre production company in the country will celebrate the anniversary.
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise made by about 1,600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State, USA.
The two-year study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of ship, including cruise ships, container ships and military ships, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.
Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels  around the level of a vacuum cleaner.
Reducing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half.

I couldnt ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city, says Douville.
But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity.
There are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days  now, those people can come.
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well, she says.

The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise made by about 1,600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State, USA.
The two-year study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of ship, including cruise ships, container ships and military ships, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.
Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels  around the level of a vacuum cleaner.
Reducing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half.

Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state may be because Western Australia has the fastest-growing population in Australia, not because of a rising number of sharks.

A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, went to another level-5 match to check another young referee  John Brooks.
A little later, the football club secretary arrived to pay the officials for their time  the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is clear that these men do not do it for the money.

It is possible that we could use this technology to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking, said Alexander Huth, the main author of the study.
Each person heard about 25,000 words  and more than 3,000 different words  as they lay in the scanner.
The atlas shows how words and related terms use the same regions of the brain.
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have many meanings.
One part of the brain, for example, is used for the word top and also for other words that describe clothes.
If they force people outside the bar to smoke, it is going to increase the tension thats already there.
I couldnt ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city, says Douville.
But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity.
There are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days  now, those people can come.
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well, she says.
We can have clean air without noise problems  I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.

The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world  more than ever before  which examine differences between organic and regular fruit, vegetables and cereals.
Another criticism of the research is that the differences it found may be the result of different climates, different types of soil and different types of crops; they may not be the result of organic farming.
Browning said: This research supports what people think about organic food.
In other countries, there is much more support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming.

As soon as the children at a primary school in Stirling, Scotland, hear the words daily mile, they leave the classroom and start running around the school  eld.
For three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at St Ninians Primary School have walked or run a mile each day.
Just in Stirling, 30 schools have already started or are going to start the daily mile.
Researchers from Stirling University have begun a study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile.

The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise made by about 1,600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State, USA.
The two-year study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of ship, including cruise ships, container ships and military ships, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.
Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels  around the level of a vacuum cleaner.
Reducing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half.
