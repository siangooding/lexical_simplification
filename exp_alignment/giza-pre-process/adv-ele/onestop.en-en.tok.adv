The Seattle-based company has applied for its brand to be a top-level domain name ( currently .com ) , but the South American governments argue this would prevent the use of this internet address for environmental protection , the promotion of indigenous rights and other public interest uses .
Until now , the differences between commercial , governmental and other types of identity were easily distinguished in every internet address by .com , .gov and 20 other categories .
Amazon has applied for dozens of new domains , including .shop , .song , .book and .kindle .
Allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to reinforce their brand strategy or to profit from the meaning of these names does not serve , in our view , the public interest , the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said .
Brazil said its views were endorsed last month by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty ( Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Guyana , Suriname and Venezuela ) .
Argentina has lodged an expression of its unhappiness that the US outdoor clothing retailer , Patagonia , is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament .
Argentina rejects the .patagonia request for a new generic top-level domain , the government notes in an appeal .
Patagonia is a relevant region for the countrys economy because it has oil , fishing , mining and agriculture resources .
But Bartho Boer , a spokesman for the Mayor , denies that the plans are illiberal .
We want everyone to be who he and she is whether they are gay and lesbian or stand up to violence and are then victims of harassment .
We as a society want to defend them .
It would be more accurate to call them scum houses than scum villages , says Boer , because we dont want to put more than one of these families in the same area .
They are taken care of so the whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in , says Boer .
She has now exploded into the public consciousness with an album and a huge hit single , Show das Poderosas , which topped the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views .
This is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation .
In Brazilian cities , white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of African descent .
Maycon de Mattos Batista , a financial analyst who worked with Anitta while she was an intern , said there had been a huge change in Anittas image , but not of her colour .
I dont believe its whitening ; its more the way they are producing her with makeup , hairstylists and the way she dresses , he said .
Oxfam said the worlds poorest could be lifted out of poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012 .
In China , the top 10 % now take home nearly 60 % of the income .
Chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in South Africa , which is now the most unequal country on Earth and significantly more unequal than at the end of apartheid .
In the US , the share of national income going to the top 1 % has doubled since 1980 from 10 to 20 % , the report says .
Oxfam said world leaders should learn from countries such as Brazil , which has grown rapidly while reducing inequality .
She said closing tax havens , which the Tax Justice Network says hold as much as $ 31 trillion , or as much as a third of all global wealth , could yield $ 189bn in additional tax revenues .
Back in 2005 , when BlackBerry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone , the company was just entering its boom times .
Free to download and use , they use the internet to swap text messages , pictures , voice clips , stickers , and even videos in WhatsApps case , between most types of phones .
The move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late , says James Gooderson , an 18-year-old student who blogs on technology .
BBM claims 80 million monthly users after its upgrade , but WhatsApp has 300 million .
Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry handsets have not migrated to the Apple and Android versions .
Nearly 80 % of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application , says the research firm Enders Analysis , but two-thirds use more than one .
Its a much more complex , multifaceted environment , says Benedict Evans , a digital media specialist at Enders .
He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging , uses an iPhone over wi-fi to play games and makes phone calls on an HTC-branded Android phone .
South American Indians have chewed coca 3 leaves for centuries .

The figures , released by the Chartered Management Institute ( CMI ) , reveal that men in UK management roles earned average bonuses of 6,442 in 2012 compared with 3,029 for women .
In the most senior roles , female directors received bonuses of 36,270 over the past 12 months , compared with 63,700 awarded to male directors .

At a far smaller rally in Brasilia , demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the high-security area of the national congress .
In Belo Horizonte , police clashed with protesters who tried to break through a cordon around a football stadium hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti .
But now Brazil is once again in crisis , with a constant rise in prices , so people are finally reacting .
Brazilians tend to be too nice sometimes they enjoy partying rather than protesting but something is changing , said Deli Borsari , a 53-year-old yoga instructor .
Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children , as the sound of shots perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas was heard .
Another protest march , near Rios Maracana Stadium , was met with a similarly heavy police response .
Health warnings covering nearly two-thirds of cigarette packs and a ban on menthol cigarettes across the EU have come a step nearer following a vote in the European Parliament .
However , we are disappointed with the decision to reject the proposal to regulate nicotine-containing products ( NCPs ) , including e-cigarettes , as medicines .
Figures show smoking levels in England are at their lowest since records began 19.5 per cent but we are determined to further reduce rates of smoking and believe this important step will help .
The MEPs voted to put health warnings on 65 % of each cigarette pack , as opposed to a proposed 75 % .
Maria van der Hoeven , Executive Director of the IEA , said : Coals share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year and , if no changes are made to current policies , coal will catch oil within a decade .
According to the IEA , demand from China and India will drive world coal use in the coming five years , with India likely to overtake the US as the worlds second biggest consumer .
China is the biggest coal importer , and Indonesia the biggest exporter , having temporarily overtaken Australia .
According to the IEAs Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today the equivalent of the current coal consumption of Russia and the US combined .
Illegal downloading is a kind of moral squalor and theft , as much as reaching in to someones pocket and stealing their wallet is theft , says author Philip Pullman .
He is highly critical of internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them .
It is outrageous that anyone can steal an artists work and get away with it .
His article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street , where the issue of web piracy was discussed .
Pullman , writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy , says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level that gives delight to their audiences and , as soon as they achieve that , the possibility of making a living from it is taken away from them .
The magazines editor , Rachael Jolley , said : Existing copyright laws dont work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers .
We need new models for how artists , writers and musicians earn a living from their work .
Data collected by Ofcom ( the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries ) suggests that , between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK , 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated , along with 52 million TV shows , 29 million films , 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files .
So he tried crowdfunding on a US website , Indiegogo , which had recently opened up in the UK .
For Danae Ringelmann , co-founder of Indiegogo , the gravity light is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowdfunding can be and how it can test an entrepreneurs idea .
International activity is up 41 % since December .
The site levies a 4 % fee for successful campaigns .
A British woman , Lauren Pears , raised 100,000 to open a cat caf in London through the site .
Known as Lady Dinahs Cat Emporium , it is yet to open but is billed as somewhere people can come in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair , a hot cup of tea , a book and a cat .
On some sites , there was an option to click , saying : Id like kids someday , but you would read the persons profile and think : You will never have time !
And I just thought : You shouldnt be ashamed of this .
The site has come at an opportune time for the country of five million people .
Now , I hope , men and women who want to start a family but havent met the right person yet will have another option , says Limal .
My goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner and wholl stay together .
Im a romantic at heart .
Danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and , because the countrys so small , a Jutlander can date a Copenhagener without too much travel , Limal said .
Early on Saturday morning , he reached the summit of Nuptse , the first and lowest of the three main summits in the Everest horseshoe that surrounds the glaciated valley called the Western Cwm .
That same day , he climbed up to the summit of Everest itself , reaching the top in complete darkness early on Sunday .
Ive asked Cool to look forward and imagine what top climbers might be doing 60 years from now .
Steck , he says , was planning to climb Everests west ridge , first done in 1963 , descend to the South Col and then immediately climb Lhotse via a new route , all without fixed ropes .
It was the highest rescue yet performed on Everest and highlights the exponential rise in helicopter flights in recent years .
Theres less water for agriculture and less water for all the new lodges that are getting built .
Every village is digging a pit just beyond the houses for garbage .
The other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike , followed by four minutes of Tabata intervals , four times a week plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of intervals .
After six weeks of testing , the group following Tabatas plan exercising for just 88 minutes a week had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28 % and their VO2 max , a key indicator of cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power , by 15 % .
The first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard .
So while it is used by most people to get fit or by fit people to get even fitter it also burns fat .
I decided to do this because I often go on YouTube and , while I am honoured that people are doing it , some are doing it wrong because they dont realize the intensity you need to work at , says Tabata .
Gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three Tabatas a week .
The problem is that , in the US and UK , most people who want to sign up for Facebook have already done it , said new media specialist Ian Maude at Enders Analysis .
The number of minutes Americans spend on Facebook appears to be falling , too .
The total was 121 billion minutes in December 2012 , but that fell to 115 billion minutes in February , according to comScore .
The most significant is Facebook Home , software that can be downloaded onto certain Android phones to feed news and photos from friends and advertising directly to the owners locked home screen .
That way , the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first chamber .
So , just like our mouse , it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good high-variance ongoing events .
He added : Our study showed that the false memory and the genuine memory are based on very similar , almost identical , brain mechanisms .
Memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not , as is often assumed , work like a video camera , faithfully recording all of the details of anything we experience .
He cautioned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have generated controversy within psychology and psychiatry for example , false memories of childhood sexual abuse , or even memories for bizarre ritualized satanic abuse , abduction by aliens , or past lives .
Can false memories be artificially created ?
What about false memories for more than just contexts false memories for objects , food or other mice ?
While he will become a United director and ambassador , the club will now have to find someone to replace a man who has won 13 English Premier League titles , two Champions Leagues , the Cup Winners Cup , five FA Cups and four League Cups .
It was important to me to leave an organization in the strongest possible shape and I believe I have done so .
Without their contribution , the history of this great club would not be as rich .
In my early years , the backing of the board , and Sir Bobby Charlton in particular , gave me the confidence and time to build a football club , rather than just a football team .
I will always cherish the wonderful memories he has given us , like that magical night in Moscow .
Alexs vision , energy and ability have built teams both on and off the pitch that his successor can count on as among the best and most loyal in world sport .
What he has done for this club and for the game in general will never be forgotten .
It has been the greatest experience of my working life being alongside Alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend .

According to the IEAs Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today the equivalent of the current coal consumption of Russia and the US combined .
Illegal downloading is a kind of moral squalor and theft , as much as reaching in to someones pocket and stealing their wallet is theft , says author Philip Pullman .
He is highly critical of internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them .
It is outrageous that anyone can steal an artists work and get away with it .
His article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street , where the issue of web piracy was discussed .
Pullman , writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy , says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level that gives delight to their audiences and , as soon as they achieve that , the possibility of making a living from it is taken away from them .
The magazines editor , Rachael Jolley , said : Existing copyright laws dont work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers .
We need new models for how artists , writers and musicians earn a living from their work .
Data collected by Ofcom ( the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries ) suggests that , between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK , 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated , along with 52 million TV shows , 29 million films , 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files .
So he tried crowdfunding on a US website , Indiegogo , which had recently opened up in the UK .
For Danae Ringelmann , co-founder of Indiegogo , the gravity light is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowdfunding can be and how it can test an entrepreneurs idea .
International activity is up 41 % since December .
The site levies a 4 % fee for successful campaigns .
A British woman , Lauren Pears , raised 100,000 to open a cat caf in London through the site .
Known as Lady Dinahs Cat Emporium , it is yet to open but is billed as somewhere people can come in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair , a hot cup of tea , a book and a cat .
On some sites , there was an option to click , saying : Id like kids someday , but you would read the persons profile and think : You will never have time !
And I just thought : You shouldnt be ashamed of this .
The site has come at an opportune time for the country of five million people .
Now , I hope , men and women who want to start a family but havent met the right person yet will have another option , says Limal .
My goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner and wholl stay together .
Im a romantic at heart .
Danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and , because the countrys so small , a Jutlander can date a Copenhagener without too much travel , Limal said .
Early on Saturday morning , he reached the summit of Nuptse , the first and lowest of the three main summits in the Everest horseshoe that surrounds the glaciated valley called the Western Cwm .
That same day , he climbed up to the summit of Everest itself , reaching the top in complete darkness early on Sunday .
Ive asked Cool to look forward and imagine what top climbers might be doing 60 years from now .
Steck , he says , was planning to climb Everests west ridge , first done in 1963 , descend to the South Col and then immediately climb Lhotse via a new route , all without fixed ropes .
It was the highest rescue yet performed on Everest and highlights the exponential rise in helicopter flights in recent years .
Theres less water for agriculture and less water for all the new lodges that are getting built .
Every village is digging a pit just beyond the houses for garbage .
The other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike , followed by four minutes of Tabata intervals , four times a week plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of intervals .
After six weeks of testing , the group following Tabatas plan exercising for just 88 minutes a week had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28 % and their VO2 max , a key indicator of cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power , by 15 % .
The first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard .
So while it is used by most people to get fit or by fit people to get even fitter it also burns fat .
I decided to do this because I often go on YouTube and , while I am honoured that people are doing it , some are doing it wrong because they dont realize the intensity you need to work at , says Tabata .
Gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three Tabatas a week .
The problem is that , in the US and UK , most people who want to sign up for Facebook have already done it , said new media specialist Ian Maude at Enders Analysis .
The number of minutes Americans spend on Facebook appears to be falling , too .
The total was 121 billion minutes in December 2012 , but that fell to 115 billion minutes in February , according to comScore .
The most significant is Facebook Home , software that can be downloaded onto certain Android phones to feed news and photos from friends and advertising directly to the owners locked home screen .
That way , the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first chamber .
So , just like our mouse , it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good high-variance ongoing events .
He added : Our study showed that the false memory and the genuine memory are based on very similar , almost identical , brain mechanisms .
Memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not , as is often assumed , work like a video camera , faithfully recording all of the details of anything we experience .
He cautioned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have generated controversy within psychology and psychiatry for example , false memories of childhood sexual abuse , or even memories for bizarre ritualized satanic abuse , abduction by aliens , or past lives .
Can false memories be artificially created ?
What about false memories for more than just contexts false memories for objects , food or other mice ?
While he will become a United director and ambassador , the club will now have to find someone to replace a man who has won 13 English Premier League titles , two Champions Leagues , the Cup Winners Cup , five FA Cups and four League Cups .
It was important to me to leave an organization in the strongest possible shape and I believe I have done so .
Without their contribution , the history of this great club would not be as rich .
In my early years , the backing of the board , and Sir Bobby Charlton in particular , gave me the confidence and time to build a football club , rather than just a football team .
I will always cherish the wonderful memories he has given us , like that magical night in Moscow .
Alexs vision , energy and ability have built teams both on and off the pitch that his successor can count on as among the best and most loyal in world sport .
What he has done for this club and for the game in general will never be forgotten .
It has been the greatest experience of my working life being alongside Alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend .
Allen , a former volunteer with the Red Cross , has been leading classes in the north-east seaside town for 45 years .
At its peak , Allens class had more than 18 regulars , each paying 1 a time .
I just cant stop , she says , phoning me a few days after the interview to read out a ditty she has written about the joys of exercise .
Allen still plays the piano and gives speeches .
Ageing is no fun , she admits , reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called That Beast Called Age .
Whenever I hear someone saying , Oh , I cant lose weight , I say : Sellotape .
I said this just the other day to a big fat man .
Earlier in 2013 , Allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the British Empire Medal .
More than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the Sahel .
The report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm , Sweden , where 2,500 politicians , UN bodies , non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to address global water supply problems .
Junior Smart knows a lot about gangs .
Eventually he was arrested for serious drug-related offences and was sent to prison for 12 years .
The first night after I was arrested was the biggest wake-up call of my life , he says .
They work with the police , the probation service and other , voluntary organizations to help those who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs that operate across London .
For Smart , the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he witnessed , from within , a prison system that was so obviously failing its inmates .
It is a bit like a family .
It means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a long-term effect .
Can it actually make the streets more dangerous ?
I try to engage a young person who has been earning 300 a week through illegal methods .
The security situation is already bad .
Nobody knows which came first : the economic crisis tearing Greece apart or shisha , the drug now known as the cocaine of the poor .
Since the outbreak of the crisis in 2009 , Kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff .
On the streets of Athens , the breeding ground of shisha , there is rising fear that austerity not only doesnt work it kills .
In a concerted campaign led , the panel found , by the Chief Constable , Peter Wright the South Yorkshire Police put out their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster .
The victims had their blood tested for alcohol levels .
It was done to remove criticism of the police , Scraton said .
Noma has been named the worlds best restaurant by Restaurant magazine for three years running .
Its chef , Ren Redzepi , says that ants taste like lemon , and a pure of fermented grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like a strong fish sauce .
In 2012 , the FAO published a list of 1,909 edible species of insect and , with sponsorship from the Dutch government , plans a major international conference on this valuable food source in 2013 .
Think of that next time you pour it into your tea .
The increase will mean more pressure on agricultural land , water , forests , fisheries and biodiversity resources , as well as nutrients and energy supplies .
The Prince Hotel in Tokyo was forced to come clean after a diner complained in a blogpost that a scallop dish he had ordered contained a similar , but cheaper , type of shellfish .
Theres already a website dedicated to people wearing them looking either ridiculous or smug or , more often , both .
Search Google Images and one of the first hits is a picture of a large , naked man wearing them in the shower .
Youll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on Facebook or send them as an email .

Youve lost them in Spain , in Bali ; tell me where you havent lost them , said Abdullah .
There is still a possibility that al-Qaida could do something stupid like they have done in the past , but we havent stopped Indians from travelling to London .
In other words , do not go trekking near the border that separates the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of J &amp; K .
Amjid Gulzar , 26 , said Abdullah could search for truth and reconciliation as well as encouraging foreign visitors .
We need better infrastructure , better roads , reliable electricity .
We need more for tourists to do in the evening we dont even have one cinema in this city and there isnt enough for tourists to do after dark , he said .
In June , a local Islamic group issued a dress code for foreign tourists .
The normal time limit for bringing a civil action is three to six years , a spokesman said .

There may also be claims from Malaysia , where large numbers of people were detained during the 12-year war with communist insurgents and their supporters that began in 1948 .
A subsistence farmer , he grew vegetables and bought rice .
But meat and fish expensive , luxury products in Liberian markets but essential sources of protein remained elusive .
I saw this film about fish in a cement pool and I thought it was a good idea , said Chon , herself diagnosed with HIV in 1992 .
So many of the people I work with dont have the means to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein it doesnt cause health problems like other sources , and it is something we can farm .
Chon , founder of a faith-based NGO , began building a pool in which to farm fish .
I raised the money and built the farm , learned the proper tank layout and water flow system , said Sheehy .
The project has now grown into the Grow2Feed Liberia Fish Farm , with 12 tanks , which , when fully stocked , will each have 5,000 fish providing up to 200,000 fish per year , serving a community of 1,200 predominantly HIV-positive people , including King and his family .
They can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other staple items .
The fish farm gives these people with HIV a way of getting back into society now they are bartering and trading with people in the market every week .
Fish farming is absolutely viable in Africa , said Paul White , owner of the HydroFish fish farm in Ivory Coast , which produces 3,000 tonnes of fish each year .
Some critics are sceptical of farmed fish , citing inbred fish and high levels of toxins .
A lot of farmed fish is inbred , which does cause problems , but we are using a process with local fish sourced in Liberia , not fish from another region , said Sheehy .
A rice-growing co-op in Sierra Leone asked us if we could do this on our property so that they can feed their workers and we have had interest from Nigeria and Central America , said Sheehy .
The polygraph is widely used in the US in criminal and other cases and for security clearance for the FBI and CIA but is much less popular in Europe .
It records changes in pulse , blood pressure , sweating and breathing to ascertain whether a subject is lying .
The second test involved a lost wallet containing 5 .
The use of all-body suits is expensive they cost about 30,000 and can be uncomfortable , and Anderson and his colleagues are now looking at low-cost alternatives .
A girl born today in the UK can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average , while her brother will live to 78 .
There has been a drop in deaths among under-fives of nearly 60 % , from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010 .
In the absence of death registries or medical records , they have been willing , for instance , to take evidence from verbal autopsies deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family .
It has been dramatic in Latin America , for instance , where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010 .
They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression , musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain complained of in every country in the world anaemia , sight and hearing loss and skin disease .
The company , Mars One , plans to send four astronauts on a trip to the Red Planet to set up a human colony in 2023 .
Firstly , when on Mars their bodies will have to adapt to surface gravity that is 38 % of that on Earth .
He told The Guardian that the applicants so far ranged in age from 18 to at least 62 and , though they include women , they tended to be men .
For instance , water can be extracted from ice in the soil and Mars has sources of nitrogen , the primary element in the air we breathe .
Reality meets talent show with no ending and the whole world watching .
The first team would land on the surface of Mars in 2023 to begin constructing the colony , with a team of four astronauts every two years after that .
The mission hopes to inspire generations to believe that all things are possible , that anything can be achieved , much like the Apollo Moon landings .
Most winners ( 59 % ) give up work straight away , but 19 % carry on doing the day job and 31 % do unpaid voluntary work .
The new home is likely to come with a hot tub , with almost a third ( 29 % ) putting that on their shopping list .
A walk-in wardrobe was a must for 28 % , almost a quarter ( 24 % ) opted for a property behind electric gates , and 22 % had a games room , with 7 % installing a snooker table .
Audis were the favourite cars of 16 % of winners , with Range Rovers and BMWs also popular purchases ( 11 % each ) , as well as Mercedes ( 10 % ) and Land Rovers ( 5 % ) .
The majority ( 68 % ) choose five-star hotels overseas .
The US was the favoured destination for 27 % , followed by the Caribbean ( 9 % ) .
She listened quietly as Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary-general , described her as our hero , our champion ; and as the former British prime minister and now UN education envoy , Gordon Brown , uttered what he called the words the Taliban never wanted her to hear : happy 16th birthday , Malala .
By 14 , she was on the radar of Archbishop Desmond Tutu , who put her forward for the International Childrens Peace Prize , and , by 15 , she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee in history .
She now lives with her family in Birmingham and does what the Taliban tried to stop her doing : goes to school every day .
She cited the attack in June on a hospital in Quetta , capital of Baluchistan , and killings of female teachers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa .
The Stand with Malala petition , calling for education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school , has attracted more than four million signatures more than a million having been added shortly after Malalas speech .
When she jumped out of bed she could see a huge vapour trail hanging in the morning sky and hear the wail of car alarms from the street below .
There was a big explosion and then a series of little explosions .
Tatyana Bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite struck .
First we noticed the wind , and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see a cloud of some unspecified smoke in the sky , she said .
In Chelyabinsk itself , schools and universities were closed and many other staff told to go home early .
There were a lot of girls in shock .
Early estimates suggested more than 100,000 square metres of glass had been broken and 3,000 buildings hit .
The team from the US , Japan , Germany and the UK asked zookeepers , carers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals .
The nadir in the animals well-being occurred , on average , at 28.3 and 27.2 years old for the chimpanzees , and 35.4 years old for the orangutans .
Robin Dunbar , Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University , was dubious about the findings .
But Weiss believes the findings could point to a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis some men may experience .
If we want to find the answer as to whats going on with the midlife crisis , we should look at what is similar in middle-aged humans , chimps and orangutans , he said .
Michael Thali , the Director of Zurichs Institute for Forensic Medicine in Europe , and one of the inventors of Virtopsy , said it had the potential to revolutionize criminal investigations .
Basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more as a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence , he said .
Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the development of the new method for themselves .
In order to analyze the colour of the blood , the consistencies ( of body fluids ) or smells , well need to keep on with the conventional cut , said Lars Oesterhelweg , Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit Hospital in Berlin , which is using a version of the Virtopsy .
He added that the new method was particularly helpful in re-examining cases where the cause of death was unclear .
But more can , and should , be done to increase transparency and build public support for privacy protections in place .
Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice said : The Intelligence Committee bill and the USA Freedom Act present two opposing visions of the relationship between law-abiding Americans and the national security state .
Leahy and Sensenbrenner say yes ; Feinstein says no .

The National Security Agency ( NSA ) has obtained direct access to the systems of Google , Facebook , Apple and other US internet giants , according to a top-secret document .
The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called PRISM , which allows officials to collect material including search history , the content of emails , file transfers and live chats , the document says .
In a statement , Google said : Google cares deeply about the security of our users data .
From time to time , people allege that we have created a government back door into our systems , but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data .
They said they would never have been involved in such a program .
If they are doing this , they are doing it without our knowledge , one said .
An Apple spokesman said he had never heard of PRISM .
The NSA access was enabled by changes to US surveillance law , introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012 .
The news was announced to the country by the current president , Jacob Zuma , who , in a sombre televised address , said Mandela had departed around 8.50pm local time and was at peace .
Some people were draped in South African flags and the green , yellow and black colours of Mandelas party , the African National Congress ( ANC ) .
Born Rolihlahla Dalibhunga in a small village in the Eastern Cape on 18 July , 1918 , Mandela was given his English name , Nelson , by a teacher at his school .
After the Sharpeville massacre , in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police , he took the difficult decision to launch an armed struggle .
His 91st birthday was marked by the first annual Mandela Day in his honour .
Married three times , he had six children , 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren .
The number of wild royal bengal tigers in Nepal has increased to 198 a 63.6 % rise in five years the government survey showed .
This is very encouraging , said Maheshwar Dhakal , an ecologist with Nepals Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation .
Dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in India and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013 .
It will take a few more months for India , which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas , to finalize the data , he added .
But they say Nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat .
Wildlife authorities captured a tiger in Chitwan after it killed two people , including a villager who was pulled from his bed in May .
Chitwan National Park in central Nepal has the highest number of adult tigers , with 120 , followed by Bardiya National Park ( 50 ) and Shukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve ( 17 ) .
In Nepal , kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions .
But one thing he couldnt do was change the elevation of the sun .
Deep in its eastwest valley , surrounded by high mountains , Rjukan and its 3,400 inhabitants are in shadow for half the year .
During the day , from late September to mid-March , the town , three hours north-west of Oslo , is not completely dark , but its certainly not bright , either .
grins Ingrid Sparbo , disbelievingly , lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes .
Two young mothers wheel their children into the square and stand in the sun .
This will bring much happiness .
The first inkling of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil , or Sun mirror , came to him as the month of September began to fade : Every day , we would take our young child for a walk in the buggy , he says , and , every day , I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun .
Twelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil , a German company specializing in so-called CSP concentrated solar power helicoptered in the three 17-sq-m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan .
But ... well , it does feel nice , standing here .
In his office overlooking the square , Rjukans energetic young mayor , Steinar Bergsland , is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town .
Now its actually here , people love it .
Barack Obama flew back to Washington and his desk in the Oval Office on Wednesday , hours after delivering an election victory speech in Chicago in which he called for the country to unite behind him .
He cited the need for both parties to find common ground and take steps together to help our economy grow and create jobs , which is critical to solving our debt .
We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions , and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states .
More than two-thirds of older people live in poor countries ; by 2050 , this proportion is expected to be about four-fifths .
Bolivia , ranked 46 , despite being one of the poorest countries , has introduced progressive policies for older people , with a national plan on ageing , free health care and a non-contributory universal pension .
In the Philippines , older people have benefited from the educational reforms introduced after independence in 1946 , which made elementary and high school education compulsory .
This is a huge day for Wales , for devolution and , most importantly , for the 226 people in Wales waiting for an organ transplant , said the Welsh Health Minister , Mark Drakeford .
As a society , we have shown we are prepared to take action to increase organ donation and to provide hope to those people waiting every week for a transplant .
Relatives are to have a clear right of objection , giving them the chance to show that the deceased would not have wanted to be an organ donor .
Doctors are delighted at the move .
Big efforts have been made in recent years to increase the number of those who carry an organ donation card , with a good deal of success .
But the increase in numbers of organs harvested is still not enough .
Members of the Muslim Council of Wales and the South Wales Jewish Representative Council have expressed reservations , while the Archbishop of Wales , Barry Morgan , said that donation ought to be a gift of love , of generosity .
From 28 February 2013 , at 20.00 hours , he told a gathering of cardinals in the Vatican , the see of Rome , the see of Saint Peter , will be vacant and a conclave to elect the new supreme pontiff will have to be convoked by those whose competence it is .
He has completed his series of books and most of his projects are off the ground .
What is more , there were no dates in his calendar of events he personally had to attend .
Thavis agreed : What I find particularly courageous is that he is prepared to say now , when he is not sick , that he is going ; and that hes doing it because hes tired and not because hes particularly ill .
Does he know more about his state of health than the Vatican has so far made public ?
Other theories will no doubt swirl around the Vatican in the days and weeks ahead , just as they did following the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978 , 33 days after his election .
If youre Gods chosen one , how do you choose not be chosen ?
One in the army , one socially in my own private time and then one with the family and stuff like that .
He said he was particularly annoyed by articles comparing his role as an Apache co-pilot gunner to Spitfire crews waiting to scramble during the second world war .
Asked whether he felt more comfortable being Captain Wales than Prince Harry , his reply was one of the most revealing he has given about his relationship with Prince Charles .
Basically , we are creating what I call an organic computer .
The rats were trained to press a lever when a light went on above it .
Only one compartment had a light that came on above the lever .
In trials , the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals 70 % of the time by pressing the lever .
This tells us that we could create a workable network of animal brains distributed in many different locations .
In theory , you could imagine that a combination of brains could provide solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves .
Theres a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan .
Work has started on designing a new tomb in Leicester Cathedral , only 100 yards from the excavation site , and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there , probably next year .
Leicesters Museums Service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site .
But many of the other injuries were after death , suggesting a gruesome ritual on the battlefield and as the kings body was brought back to Leicester , as he was stripped , mocked and mutilated .
One terrible injury , a stab through the right buttock and into his pelvis , was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour .
It was Mathew Morris who first uncovered the body , in the first hour of the first day of the excavation .
He did not believe he had found the king .
Ten days later , on 5 September , when further excavation proved Morris had hit the crucial spot , he returned with Lin Foxhall , head of the archaeology department , to excavate the body .
We did it the usual way , lifting the arms , legs and skull first , and proceeding gradually towards the torso so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that I thought : My word , I think weve got him .
Kensington Palace announced at 8.30pm that the baby was born at 4.24pm in the exclusive Lindo Wing at St Marys Hospital , Paddington , West London .
The Queen , the Duke of Edinburgh , the Prince of Wales , the Duchess of Cornwall , Prince Harry and members of both families were informed and were delighted with the news that Her Royal Highness and her child were both doing well .
In a statement , Prince Charles said : Both my wife and I are overjoyed at the arrival of my first grandchild .
Following tradition , a formal notice was posted on an ornate rococo-style easel the same used to announce Prince Williams birth in 1982 in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace shortly before 9pm .
Speaking outside 10 Downing Street , David Cameron said : It is wonderful news from St Marys , Paddington , and I am sure that , right across the country , and , indeed , right across the Commonwealth , people will be celebrating and wishing the royal couple well .
It is an important moment in the life of our nation but , I suppose , above all , it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy .
It has been a remarkable few years for our royal family : a royal wedding that captured peoples hearts , that extraordinary and magnificent jubilee and now this royal birth all from a family that has given this nation so much incredible service .
May God bless them all with love , health and happiness .
Without it , his blood would have boiled and his lungs might have exploded .
Baumgartner was carried up into crystal clear skies by a gigantic balloon , which measured 30 million square cubic feet and whose skin was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich bag .
Three cameras attached to Baumgartners suit recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes which failed to break the existing free-fall record for duration and then the parachute opening .
The former paratrooper has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave .
He was chasing five different records : the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall ; the highest free-fall altitude jump ; the highest manned balloon flight ; the longest free-fall ; and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history .
Id like to be sitting in the same spot in the next four years as Joe Kittinger .
There is a young guy asking me for advice because he wants to break my record .
To laughter , he added : The most beautiful moment was when I was standing on the landing area and Mike Todd &#91; the life support engineer who dressed Baumgartner in his suit &#93; showed up and he had a smile on his face like a little kid .
Earlier , Todd had told the press conference : The world needs a hero right now , and they got one in Felix Baumgartner .
He has promised to settle down and enjoy his post-jump years with his girlfriend , Nicole Oetl , flying helicopters on rescue missions in the US and Austria .
The campaign to save the beach was launched hours after the Tarifa council voted for the project .
The campaign has a Facebook page and is supported by groups including Greenpeace , the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Spanish branch of conservation network Birdlife .
If they put it in the centre of Tarifa , where there is space , then clients could visit shops , tapas bars and restaurants .
Longstanding Uncut campaigner Anna Walker said Weve chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women .
Starbucks is a really great target because it is on every high street across the country and thats what UK Uncut finds really important : people can take action in their local areas , she said .
The group Chief Executive , Howard Schultz , has said in a statement : Starbucks has always paid taxes in the UK despite recent suggestions to the contrary .
Over the last three years alone , our company has paid more than 160m in various taxes , including National Insurance contributions , VAT and business rates .
We do need to make sure we are encouraging these businesses to invest in our country as they are , but they should be paying fair taxes as well .
We spend hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk , cakes and sandwiches , and on store design and renovations .

Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop , that are only used in short courses and that quickly become ineffective due to the evolution of bacterial resistance .
This is a war like no other .
But are the countrys prisons a soft option ?
The head of Swedens prison and probation service , Nils Oberg , announced in November 2013 that four Swedish prisons are to be closed due to an out of the ordinary decline in prisoner numbers .
Although there has been no fall in crime rates , between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6 % drop in Swedens prisoner population , now a little over 4,500 .
The modern prison service in Sweden is very different from when I joined as a young prison officer in 1978 , says Kenneth Gustafsson , governor of Kumla Prison , Swedens most secure jail , situated 130 miles west of Stockholm .
The overall reoffending rate in Sweden stands at between 30 and 40 % over three years to compare that with another European country , the number is around half that of the UK .
One strong reason for the drop in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in Sweden .
There are some people who will not or cannot change .
But , in my experience , the majority of prisoners want to change , and we must do what we can to help to facilitate that .
As you can see , everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists , these extremists , an army officer announced .
In the centre of town , a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of shelling .

Ethiopia is one of the worlds poorest countries , well known for its precarious food security situation .
Teffs tiny seeds the size of poppy seeds are high in calcium , iron and protein , and boast an impressive set of amino acids .
Its strategy , published in 2013 , argues that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes , and help reduce malnutrition particularly among children and adolescents .
Mama Fresh is a family firm that has been selling injera to top restaurants and hotels in the Ethiopian capital for years .
It aims to double exports to America in 2014 and will soon start producing teff-based pizzas , bread and cookies .
With little Ethiopian teff on the international market , farmers in the US have started planting the crop .
Farmers in Europe , Israel and Australia have also experimented with it .

In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote , Obama said he hoped the deal would lift the cloud of uncertainty that had hung over the country in recent weeks .
The highest levels of violence against women are in Africa , where nearly half of all women 45.6 % will suffer physical or sexual violence .
That , says the report , is often the first opportunity for violence in the home to be detected and for the woman to be offered help .
Violence has a profound effect on womens health .
For the first time , we have compared data from all over the world on the magnitude of partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the impact of these sorts of violence on health , said Garcia-Moreno .
Even in high-income countries , 23.2 % of women will suffer physical and / or sexual violence from a partner in their lives , their data from 81 countries shows .
What is societys attitude concerning the acceptability of certain forms of violence against women ?
But , if you see a woman coming back several times with undisclosed injuries , you should be asking about domestic violence , said Garcia-Moreno .
But , on Tuesday 8th April , 2014 , she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle , 101 years after he had lobbed it into the Baltic Sea .
It was very surprising , Erdmann , 62 , said , recalling how she found out about the bottle .
A man stood at my door and told me he had post from my grandfather .
He then told me that a message in a bottle had been found and that the name that was on the card was that of my grandfather .
Holger von Neuhoff , curator for ocean and science at the museum , said this bottled message was the oldest he had come across .
Researchers believe Erdmanns grandfather , Richard Platz , threw the bottle in the sea while on a hike with a nature appreciation group in 1913 .
She said she was moved by the arrival of the message , although she had not known her grandfather because he died , at the age of 54 , six years before she was born .
I knew very little about my grandfather , but I found out that he was a writer who was very open-minded , and believed in freedom and that everyone should respect each other , she said .
Like her grandfather , Erdmann said , she also liked culture and travelling around the world .
We want to make a few photos available to put with the bottle and give it a face , so visitors can see the young man who threw the bottle into the water , she said .
Snoozing was losing and sleep was for wimps .

But , for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit , Nunavut , life in the land of the midnight sun poses a real challenge during the month of Ramadan , during which Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset .
The only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health , Karim said .
Most in Iqaluit adhere to the timetable followed by Muslims in Ottawa , some 1,300 miles south of the city following the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city .
It still means fasting for some 18 hours a day , said Atif Jilani , who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto in 2015 .
Its long days , but more manageable .
In recent years , much of the community has opted to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton , in Alberta .
Some , such as Awan a father of two young children , including a 12-yearold who recently started fasting follow the timings of Mecca .
He hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about 15 hours of fasting as compared with about 18 hours in Edmonton .
If I fast Yellowknife or Edmonton times , my son might say , Papa , you are really insane .
Faced with the impossibility of following the local movements of the sun , the 100 or so Muslims in Inuvik , a small town that sits 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle , have also been following Edmontons timetable .
Youre supposed to break your fast when its dusk and we eat when the sun is out .
In Inuvik , where much of the population is Inuit , the Muslim community has sought to strike a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions .
We make a soup or curry but instead of using beef , we use reindeer .
Its particularly true for those like Karim who have determinedly followed the local sunrise and sunset .
Ramadan will eventually fall during winter , which , in Iqaluit , sees the sun rise and set within a few hours each day .
Oh yes , definitely .
People lacking qualifications who want to use MOOCs as a bridge to higher education ?
While this may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without high-level qualifications , it does , he says , suggest that MOOCs could be a really good tool for continuing education .
Instead , he suggests a blended approach that combines a campus experience with a MOOC ; also , perhaps , using MOOCs to create a global degree , with students taking courses from across the world , might be possible .
If people are genuinely fascinated by learning , then why not ?
The real challenge is to allow those countries not just to consume and study MOOCs , but also to create them .
Another factory owner , who declined to be named , said that once a factory closed its doors , even for a few months , it would lose orders and close permanently : There is no such thing as temporary closure , he said .
Jenny Holdcroft , policy director for IndustriALL , which has been closely involved in the Accord , said that the agreement ensured that factories would not lose orders during closure because brands had committed to maintain orders with suppliers for two years .
Brands dont want to commit to paying so that rich factory owners who have just pocketed the profits and not been spending on their factories for years continue to do so .
A spokesman for the Accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not hold up its work to improve safety in factories .
We had a big meeting with the Accord to make them understand they have to come forward or how will we help our workers ?
The children who learn in this three-square-metre room are the lucky ones , however .
After they leave work , they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school .
In 2015 , SOHAY helped 1,540 children to leave hazardous work and 2,125 vulnerable children those in danger of entering work into school .
About 780 more children are preparing to enter school in 2017 .

Many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited .
Instead , they decide to train their powerful telescopes on Jupiter and Venus and later to pick out stars such as Capella and Betelgeuse .
An additional attraction is the appearance of the International Space Station .
In Northumberland Dark Sky Park , as the area was rebadged , it is so dark that Venus casts a shadow on the Earth .
Many of the 1.5 million who visit Northumberland each year are now aware of its Dark Sky status .
He is planning Britains first astrovillage , one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium , a 100-seat planetarium , a one-metre aperture telescope , and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes .
If you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch , what could be better than the universe ?
Only Belgium , Denmark , the Netherlands and Luxembourg in mainland Europe like Britain have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivore species .
Guillaume Chapron from Swedens University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across Europe found wolves , in some cases , living in suburban areas alongside up to 3,050 people per square kilometre higher than the population density of Cambridge or Newcastle .
In order to have wolves , we dont need to remove people from the landscape , said Chapron .
Most crucial , said Chapron , has been the EU Habitats Directive , which has compelled member states to protect and revive rare species .
Without the Habitats Directive , I dont think we would have had this recovery , he said .
If it works in the rest of Europe , theres absolutely no reason why it cant work in the UK , he said , pointing out that bears and wolves are found within an hour of Rome .
Theres no demographic reason why we cant have a similar return of wildlife in the UK .
Now , we need to build another one , he says with a grin .
French is not as easy as English but , two weeks ago , I decided there was no way to get to the UK , says George , another Darfur refugee and dedicated student .

When Larry Pizzi , a veteran bicycle industry executive , first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago , he asked : Why would anyone want to screw up a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it ?
Pizzi , who is now CEO of Currie Technologies , the number one seller of e-bikes in the US , believes thats about to change .
They are popular in much of Europe , too .
Theyre common in the Netherlands and Switzerland ; German postal workers use them to get around and BMW offers one for about $ 3,000 .
Electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds , which rely on motorized power ; they are bicycles that can be pedalled with or without assistance from an electric motor .
Batteries are getting smaller , theyre getting lighter , theyre getting more reliable and they are lasting longer , says Don DiCostanza , the founder and CEO of Pedego , an electric bikemaker and retailer .
Perhaps most importantly , as more cities build cycling infrastructure , including dedicated bike lanes , bicycle commuting has become more popular .
Most of our customers are ageing baby boomers who want to rekindle the experience they had as a kid , says Pedegos Don DiCostanza .
ElectroBike , which operates 30 stores in Mexico , opened its first American store in Venice Beach , California in the autumn of 2014 and hopes to grow to 25 US stores in a year .

Axani had made headlines in 2014 after offering an air ticket to any Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher .
It wasnt easy and it certainly wasnt immediate .
It took us about a week to really figure each other out , Axani said .
So thats a lot of stories , thats a lot of individuals and thats a lot of love for their home city of Prague .
It was a real adventure .
In terms of his love life , Axani said he was not looking for his next Elizabeth Gallagher just yet .
His condition isnt good , but hes getting better , said Ola Fjeldstad , a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on the isolated Ebon Atoll , part of the Marshall Islands archipelago .
If you have no fresh water and it doesnt rain for a few days , so you cant collect rainwater , you have basically had it .

The sum of 1m in 500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag , where the same amount in 50 notes would require a small suitcase .
In 2009 , Italys central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists .
Peter Sands , the former head of Standard Chartered Bank , has called for the abolition of high-denomination notes , including the 500 , the $ 100 , the 1,000 Swiss Franc note and the 50 .
The 500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born : it replaced the 1,000 Deutschmark , the 10,000 Belgian franc and the 500,000 Italian lira .
A modest cultural centre in the capital city , Havana , has suddenly become a rare source of free wi-fi .
The internationally renowned Cuban artist Kcho is providing the service .
The chance to click on international news websites , communicate with friends and family overseas and use sites like Facebook and Twitter has created a massive buzz .
The artist said he wanted to encourage Cubans to familiarize themselves with the internet .
Born on one of Cubas outlying islands , he is known for contemporary art with rustic , seaside and patriotic themes and imagery .
Kcho is estimated to be paying $ 900 a month to provide the free wi-fi .
Since 2013 , Cuban authorities have opened hundreds of internet salons , where an hour online costs $ 4.50 , at speeds far lower than those at Kchos studio of around 2mbps .
He had his first UK number 1 album with Aladdin Sane ( 1973 ) , which generated the hit singles The Jean Genie and Drive-in Saturday .
Lets Dance moulded Bowie into a crowd-friendly global rock star , with the album and its singles Lets Dance , China Girl and Modern Love all becoming huge international hits .
A few days after his appearance at the Freddie Mercury tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in April 1992 , Bowie married the Somalian model Iman and the couple bought a home in New York .
For the album Black Tie White Noise ( 1993 ) , he sprinkled elements of soul , electronica and hip hop into the mix .
It topped the UK album chart and yielded a top 10 single , Jump They Say .
As an adopted New Yorker , Bowie was the opening act at the Concert for New York City in October 2001 , where he joined Paul McCartney , Jon Bon Jovi , Billy Joel , the Who and Elton John in a benefit show six weeks after the 9 / 11 attacks .
The album topped charts in Britain and around the world .
In 2014 , Bowie was given the Brit Award for Best British Male , making him the oldest British recipient in the awards history .
He is survived by Iman , their daughter , Alexandria , his stepdaughter , Zulekha , and his son , Duncan , from his first marriage .
So , it better be good .

The environmental supervision agency , OEFA , says that three poorer neighbourhoods , despite having only 12 % of Limas population , have by far the most fly-tipped rubbish : Villa Maria del Triunfo ( 39.4 % ) , Villa El Salvador ( 25.3 % ) and El Agustino ( 18.3 % ) .
Other countries , such as China and Korea , which are also considering real-world emissions tests , will be watching what happens next closely .
One key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars , causing many times more pollution on the road , said Greg Archer , the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment .
According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2014 , actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg / km standard , with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit .
Real Driving Emissions ( RDE ) is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicles production lifetime , said Cara McLaughlin , a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association ( ACEA ) .
However , ACEA fully accepts that RDE will apply to new types of cars from September 2017 .
By 2017 , the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest .
Just after I got into the water , Dusty left the woman she was with and went ballistic I found out afterwards that shes very territorial when she is with somebody .
Her tail was flapping wildly and , at first , I thought it was a display but , then , I twigged : maybe shes angry .
I felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way , I began to struggle with loud noises and I suffered from memory loss .
I am grateful that I am healthy and I really want to prevent other people being injured .

However , it also found that 30 % were not saving any money .
Michael Day , 30 , who lives with his parents in Bristol , says he has been caught between paying high rents and saving for a mortgage deposit .
I dont really want to move out to rent as its more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage so its been a bit of a vicious circle .
Most will be more than happy to house them in the family home rent-free because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner , she said .
Jenna Gavin , 29 , lives in Southport , Merseyside , in the family home where she grew up .
But renting a one-bedroom flat would cost more than 420 a month before bills , which would take up a lot of her earnings .
Ive looked at buying and seen mortgage advisers but I just cant borrow enough to get on the property ladder .
As a woman , its made me happy , Vronique Soulier , president of the clubs supporters association , told journalists .
She previously coached Benficas male youth teams , the Qatar womens team , which she led to its first international victory in 2012 , and , more recently , the Iranian womens national side , which she left in September 2013 .
Not the Argentinian and FC Barcelona record-breaking striker Lionel Messi , but Junior Messi Enguene , a 20-year-old midfielder from Cameroon .
I told myself that , if I took charge of a club again , Id hire a woman as my number two .
In my opinion , its just a publicity stunt to get people talking about the club and she wont last the season .
A third wrote : I wish her welcome and success but I think itll be hard for her to make her mark as a woman in such a macho business .
But Soulier was hopeful : Hopefully , with the new manager , the club can find the motivation theyre lacking at the moment , she said .
After doing work experience at Chelsea during her compatriot Jos Mourinhos first stint as manager of the club between 2004 and 2007 , she was reportedly described as Mourinho in a skirt .

IUPAC announced that a Russian-American team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California had produced sufficient evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115 , 117 and 118 .
When elements 114 and 116 were assigned formal names in 2012 , scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively , after the Flerov Lab at Dubnas Joint Institute of Research and the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the US , where the elements were discovered .
Kosuke Morita , who led the research at RIKEN , said his team now planned to look to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond .
The Japanese team is believed to be considering three names for ununtrium : japonium , rikenium and nishinarium , after the Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science , where the element was found .
If we understand it better , hopefully we can do better at dealing with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world .
Along with new names , the scientists must propose two-letter symbols for the elements .
In 1996 , the symbol Cp was proposed for copernicium , or element 112 , but it was swapped to Cn when scientists complained that Cp referred to another substance .
To discover the elements , researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for signature radioactive decays that should come from the new elements .
Lucy Smith , Glastonburys green issues organizer , said : We have amazing water quality in the UK but everyone is obsessed with drinking bottled water .
Environmentalists estimate that 150 million tonnes of plastic waste currently litters the planet and oceans , poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife .
Millions of barrels of oil are used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and the transportation of mineral water across the planet produces even more carbon emissions .
Adults in the UK now eat an average of 75g of pizza every week compared with none in 1974 , while the consumption of pasta has almost tripled over the same period .
Fresh potatoes are also becoming less essential with a 67 % decrease from 1974 , when adults ate the equivalent of 188g every day .
Consumption of takeaway food has almost doubled since 1974 , from 80g per person per week to 150g .
Bananas have been the most popular fruit in the UK since 1996 , reaching 221g per adult per week in 2014 , well above apples ( 131g ) and oranges ( 48g ) .
Piles of digitized material from blogs , tweets , pictures and videos to official documents such as court rulings and emails may be lost forever because the programs needed to view them will become defunct , Googles vice-president has warned .
If we want to preserve them , we need to make sure that the digital objects we create today can still be rendered far into the future , he added .
More difficult still could be navigating the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies .
Were talking about preserving them for hundreds to thousands of years , said Cerf .
But Google , in the US , sent a minor earthquake through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car .
Instead , it has a smartphone app that summons it and tells it the destination , and a single STOP button mounted between the two front-facing seats in case the occupants need to override the computer .
He said of the car : Youre just sitting there ; no steering wheel , no pedals .
About ten seconds after getting in , I forgot I was there .

It was as a reporter that I soon found out that I was as bad at understanding numbers in Spanish as I was at calculating them in English .
Even worse , victims were piled too high in my stories almost 83 dead in a fi re at 6pm turned out to be as few as 38 by 7pm ; 12 people injured in a coach crash soon became two and so it went on .
I dont know what training you have had , an editor yelled , but has no one ever told you a death toll cant go down ? !
In my case , I have always found languages easy enough , apart from the numbers .
But , in that fi rst journalism job , getting the numbers wrong didnt always add up to failure .

With his Icelandic wife , Kristin , Cardew is appealing against a decision by the National Registry in the capital Reykjavik not to renew their ten-year-old daughter Harriets passport on the grounds that it does not recognize her first name .
Since the registry does not recognize the name of Harriets 12-year-old brother , Duncan , either , the two children have , until now , travelled on passports identifying them as Stlka and Drengur Cardew : Girl and Boy Cardew .
The impasse meant the family , from Kpavogur , risked missing their holiday in France until they applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport , which should now allow them to leave .
The law dictates that the names of children born in Iceland must unless both parents are foreign be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth .
If they are not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names , the parents must seek the approval of a body called the Icelandic Naming Committee .
What this means in practice is that names containing letters that do not officially exist in Icelands 32-letter alphabet , such as c , are out .
The Cardews could get round Harriets problem by giving her an Icelandic middle name .
But its a bit late for that and way too silly , said Cardew .

Rob Yarrell , national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier , said : Octopuses are famous escape artists .
Thats just his personality .
The drainpipe was 50 metres long and opened onto the waters of Hawkes Bay , on the east coast of New Zealands North Island .
Another possible escape route could have involved Inky squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank , which led under the floor to the drain .
When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty , I was really surprised , said Yarrell , who has not launched a search for Inky .
The staff and I have been pretty sad .
Reiss Jenkinson , exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium , said he was absolutely certain Inky had not been taken .
I understand the nature of octopus behaviour very well , he said .
Because octopuses have no bones , they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and have been filmed squeezing through gaps the size of coins .
At the Island Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington , an octopus was found to be in the habit of visiting another tank overnight to steal crabs , then returning to its own .
He was very friendly , very inquisitive and a popular attraction here .

It has even filtered into the world of classical music , with one of the worlds leading pianists surprising concert-goers in June 2013 when he stormed off stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone .
Krystian Zimerman returned moments later and declared : The destruction of music because of YouTube is enormous .
Our overall thinking is that filming at concerts adds to the experience , rather than taking away from it and I think , if Kate Bush came round for a cup of tea , we could have a really interesting discussion about this and we might be able to win her round , he added .

Loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly there are day centres and charities to help them , says Sam Challis , an information manager at the mental health charity Mind , but , when young people reach 21 , theyre too old for youth services .
People present an idealized version of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like those portrayed in the media , says Challis .
If recent research is to be believed , loneliness is killing the elderly and , with an ageing population , we should aim to reduce our isolation before it is too late .
Getting older doesnt have to mean getting lonelier , says Ruth Sutherland , the chief executive of the relationship counselling service Relate , in a new report .
Autism is a developmental disorder seen in more than one in 100 people .
So far , there is no established treatment for the social problems caused by autism .
But Pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions ; it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to engage more socially , he said .
Nor is it clear yet if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any unwanted side effects .
Benjamin Carle is 96.9 % made in France , right down to his underpants and socks .
Carle , 26 , set out , in 2013 , to see if it was possible to live using only French-made products for ten months as part of a television documentary .
The experiment cost Carle his smartphone , television , refrigerator ( all made in China ) ; his spectacles ( Italian ) ; his underpants ( Moroccan ) ; morning coffee ( Guatemalan ) and his adored David Bowie music ( British ) .
His foreign-made clothes , down to his underwear , were replaced with more expensive alternatives : French-produced underpants ( 26 ) , socks ( 9 ) , polo shirt ( 75 ) , espadrille sandals ( 26 ) , but no jeans as none are produced in France .
Going out with friends was problematic no American films , no Belgian beer , no sushi or pizza .
Staying home , with no sofa for the first few months and no television , meant listening to crooner Michel Sardou and reading French novels .
French wine was , of course , allowed and French-Canadian singer Cline Dion , but not , according to his advisers , French bands such as Daft Punk , who sing in English .
The last things to go were the computer , replaced by a Qooq , a recipe tablet that connects slowly to the internet and the iPhone , swapped for an old Sagem mobile .
Carles conclusion : Its not entirely possible or even desirable to live 100 % made in France , particularly in terms of new technology .
If we want to save jobs and industries , wherever we are , we might think about supporting them .
A T-shirt is more expensive in France but I can be sure it has been produced by workers who are correctly paid and have good working conditions .

As temperatures climb and oceans warm , tropical and subtropical regions will face sharp changes in annual rainfall , says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report , released in Stockholm and published online in September .
East Africa can expect to experience increased short rains , while west Africa should expect heavier monsoons .
Burma , Bangladesh and India can expect stronger cyclones ; elsewhere in southern Asia , heavier summer rains are anticipated .
Indonesia may receive less rainfall between July and October , but the coastal regions around the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand can expect increased rainfall extremes when cyclones hit land .
The IPCC makes the case that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before .
They do not need the IPCC to tell them that the weather is changing , said Saleemul Huq , director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development , based in Dhaka .
Nevertheless , there will be signifi cant geographical variations ; many millions of people living in the developing worlds great cities , including Lagos and Calcutta , are threatened .
Weather disasters are also more likely in a warmer world , the report suggests .
He gets what all referees hope for every time they referee a match .
A few weeks earlier , Riley , Dunn and another former referee , Peter Jones , made their way to another level-5 match to monitor another referee tipped to progress John Brooks .
A little later , the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is safe to assume these men do not do it for the cash .
How does he feel watching football on TV when a referee gets vilified ?
Riley , as a young referee , went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all .
Riley , as a young referee , went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all .
He also has the support of a sports psychologist , Liam Slack , for regular guidance and an exercise regime to help him handle the 11km he runs during a game .
We are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the field of play , says Riley .
Buildings warm up in a number of different ways .
The Stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it re ects 97 % of the visible light that falls on it .
When the mirror is warmed up , it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space .
You could use this on buildings so you have to spend much less on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnt need it at all .
You could put it on top of shopping malls .
The project is a key plank in Moroccos ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower .
When they are nished , the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Moroccos capital city , Rabat , and generate 580 mega-watts ( MW ) of electricity , enough to power a million homes .
Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020 , with wind and hydro taking the same share each .
Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries , according to the Moroccan solar energy agency ( Masen ) .
We believe that its possible to export energy to Europe but , rst , we would have to build the interconnectors which dont yet exist , said Maha el-Kadiri , a Masen spokeswoman .
In a three-year period , the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million , according to the 2014 digital music report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) .

Retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they cant get online , says Simon Boydell , spokesman for Marketforce , which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers on its books .
Our clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience .
Each day , they typically spend up to eight hours visiting ve to ten stores , plus another hour or two ling detailed reports on every aspect of their visit .
Shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy .
Im always given a scenario , such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range , but , within that framework , I can often buy whatever I want and keep it .
Her income is typically 30,000 to 40,000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job .
She does , however , nd it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved .
Marketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort , says Boydell .
I wont touch those jobs anymore .

A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words .
And , each single word lights up many different brain spots .
It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing , reading or possibly even thinking , said Alexander Huth , the rst author on the study .
Per person , that amounted to hearing roughly 25,000 words and more than 3,000 different words as they lay in the scanner .
The atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain .
The same region responds to killed , convicted , murdered and confessed .
On the brains right-hand side , near the top of the head , is one of the brain spots activated by family terms : wife , husband , children , parents .
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings .
One part of the brain , for example , reliably responds to the word top , along with other words that describe clothing .
One of them responds to numbers and measurements , another to buildings and places .
The scientists only scanned ve men and two women , however .
It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases .
Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension thats already there .
Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music .
Theres no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city , says Douville .
Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before , in England .
To avoid the same fate , hes spending money to build a patio .
Lost Loves Douville , though , feels the ban to be a great business opportunity .
The number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar , with our food , but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days were now an option for all those people .
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell , who introduced and pushed the ban , disagrees : The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well , she says .
The owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities .
I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses .
Bar customers are encouraged to come ll out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smoking .
Unworried , Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban .
But it doesnt mean theyre gonna win .
This learned deafness is a real issue , Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose .
We are conditioning ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears .
This gift that we are born with to reach out and hear things hundreds of metres away , all these incredible sounds is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia , he said .
For the past ten years , the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 sites across the US , including Yosemite in California , Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska .
If nding peace and quiet becomes dif cult enough , many , many children will grow up without the experience and I think its a very real problem , he said .
Speaking at the same meeting , Derrick Taff , a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University , described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks , of waterfalls , birdsong and wind , helped people recover from stressful events .
Valter Piscedda , the centre- left mayor of Elmas , a small town near Sardinias capital , Cagliari , wants to pay residents to leave .
This is , above all , an idea born of common sense and experience , he told the Guardian .
And they want to go and gain work experience abroad ; life experience , too .
In Elmas , the scheme has provoked mixed reactions .
The reality is that there is little work here , said Alessandro Macis .
said Consuelo Melis , who works behind the bar in a local café .
The work I can create , as mayor , is temporary .
Robert Mys _ ajek stops dead .
There are now an estimated 1,500 wolves in Poland .
Wolves are along with the brown bear , the lynx and the wolverine Europes last large predator carnivores .
DNA tests have established that Polish wolves are travellers .
Mys _ ajek says only scienti c arguments the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population can save Europes wild carnivores , especially the unpopular wolf .
In 1989 , when the communists relinquished power , Poland had only one motorway .
The Environment Minister , Jan Szyszko , makes no secret of being a hunter .
It is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction .
Tom Sanders , a professor of nutrition at Kings College London , said the research did show some differences .
The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world more than ever before which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit , vegetables and cereals .
Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases , including cardiovascular diseases , neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers .
The researchers found much higher levels of cadmium , a toxic metal , in conventional crops .
A further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates , soil types and crop varieties , and not from organic farming , though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences .
Browning said : This research backs up what people think about organic food .
In other countries , there have long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming .
The canoe is our island , the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader , Pittman says .
On a canoe , you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars , the moon , the sun and the birds .
The of cial title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage and it is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Oceania Regional Of ce and ve Paci c Island countries : Samoa , Tonga , New Zealand , the Cook Islands and Fiji .
The main goal of the 6,000-nautical-mile ( 11,000km ) trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress .
According to the IUCN , as of 2013 , the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take .
And the effects of climate change were already beginning to impact seriously on Paci c Islanders .
I work hard and am good at my job but , when PizzaExpress thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hard-earned tips left on a card , I get upset .
PizzaExpress joins restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi in siphoning off 8 % of the tips paid by card but other chains deduct even more .
Cafe _ Rouge , Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10 % , as do Strada and Giraffe , which is owned by Tesco .
Almost 6,000 people have so far signed Unites online petition .
One waiter , who doesnt work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain , said that at least a third of his income is from tips .
The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change .
4C would likely be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous , Sherwood said .
For example , it would make life difficult , if not impossible , in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet , with sea levels rising by many metres as a result .
When water evaporates from the oceans , the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight ; or , it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds .
Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect , said Sherwood .
But what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models which predict less warming , not those that predict more .
Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam , the proportion has been 20 % .
Amin , 61 , from rural Bangladesh , has seen his livelihood gradually decline , due to his own and his wifes illnesses , the cost of his sons marriage , the death of his father and loss of goods such as shing nets .
Lovemore , 74 , from Zimbabwe , has become one of the poorest people in his village .
He recently lost his job as a car-park attendant due to ill health and had to take in his ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters .
The second is education , from early childhood to the start of work , to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty .
Even Nigeria , with its oil wealth , spends only $ 650 per capita , Shepherd said .
We Can Do It is not a female beer but a beer brewed by women that anyone can drink , she says .
One weekend they concocted the recipe and the next they brewed 1,600 litres .
This is not a beer that is aimed at women its our hoppiest brew , says Thomas Bingebo , the head brewer at Ocean .
FemAle has already been approached by other breweries asking if they can brew new beers with them .
From all across Rwanda , and even parts of neighbouring Burundi , people ock to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza ( Sweet Dreams ) .
Here , at the central African countrys rst ice- cream parlour , customers can buy scoops in sweet cream , passion fruit , strawberry and pineapple avours .
Ice cream is important , she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering .
True to Inzozi Nzizas motto , the shop can certainly make dreams come true .
Its something uniting people here , Kalisa Migendo , a 24-year-old agriculture student , says .
Inzozi Nziza was opened by the theatre director Odile Gakire Katese .

Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills , he wrote .
What we did was to look at a set of current London taxi drivers and a set of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years , said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers , head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College London , who is an author of the study .
The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities , says Spiers .
Ultimately , McKinlay believes , its essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation .
La Premiere chose qu &apos;on regarde ( The First Thing We Look At ) by Grégoire Delacourt tells the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the book &apos;s lead male character thinks it is Johansson herself .
In the novel , the model &apos;s looks mean that men see her only as a sex object , while women are jealous of her .
She has a series of adventures as Johansson until she is eventually found out and , in the end , dies in a car crash .
Delacourt has become one of Frances best-loved authors ; his previous novel , My List of Desires , was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a lm .
I wrote a real love story and a homage to feminine beauty , especially interior beauty .
I thought she might send me owers as it was a declaration of love for her , but she didnt understand , Delacourt said .
All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of tness : stamina , handgrip strength and lower-body power .
The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular tness , muscle strength and ability to accelerate , all of which predict how good someone is at sport , in which such attributes are vital .
Those born in October were almost as t , scoring highest for strength and coming third for power , with December children close behind .
The gap in physical prowess between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide .
This is , potentially , a huge physical advantage , said Sandercock .
Such gaps could ultimately decide who became a top-level athlete because , as the paper says , selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individuals physical performance .
The ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage they are already known to have an academic advantage and , now , they also appear to be better equipped for sport , too .
Children that get a high-quality rst experience , which develops their physical literacy , are those that will have greater agility , balance and coordination , and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up , he said .
As soon as the children at one primary school in Stirling hear the words daily mile , they down their pencils and head out of the classroom to start running laps around the school eld .
For three-and-a-half years , all pupils at St Ninians Primary have walked or run a mile each day .
The thought of children across the country running every day because of something weve done is phenomenal .
In Stirling alone , 30 schools have already started or are to start the daily mile .
The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it ; otherwise , you couldnt sustain it .
At St Ninians , teachers take their pupils out of lessons on to a specially built circuit around the schools playing eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that days timetable .
The extent of the bene ts have yet to be determined but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for quantitative evidence of the physical , cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile .
Paralympian , Tanni Grey-Thompson , chair of ukactive , the UKs leading not-for-pro t health body for physical activity , said : All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day , whether in a lesson , on the walk to school or in the playground .
We know sitting still kills ; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life .
The Scottish government is also supportive .
In what Mason called the rst city-scale genetic pro le ever , his team found meningitis at Times Square , a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan .
All around the subway , bacteria associated with cheeses brie , cheddar , parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza turned up .
The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more localized to midtown Manhattan and the nancial district , and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the nancial district and Bay Ridge .
Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea , both benign and bad E.coli ( mostly benign ) , and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city .
He said he hoped the research would provide a baseline of research for health of cials and geneticists , and could help health of cials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens .
The yes campaign scored four big successes , winning 53 % of the vote in Scotlands largest city , Glasgow , 57 % in Dundee and 51 % in North Lanarkshire .
We have heard the voice of Scotland and , now , the millions of voices of England must be heard , he said .
Ed Miliband , the Labour leader , said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change .
We know our country needs to change in the way it is governed and we know our country needs to change in who it is governed for .
Theyve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years .
We will continue to ght with the facts because the facts are on our side , he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts .
Already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a naturalistic setting .

Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeares life , argues Paul Edmondson , the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust .
But Stratford is where he bought land and property , where he kept his library , where he lived and read and thought .
The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford , the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world , will be marked across Britain and the globe .
Macbeth will open in Singapore , Romeo and Juliet in Brussels .
In London , they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema , one screen to showcase each of Shakespeares plays , along the South Bank .
The National Theatre , the Royal Shakespeare Company and virtually every other theatre production company in the country will be marking the anniversary .
There will also be hundreds of lectures , recitals , international academic conferences , lms , concerts , operas and major exhibitions .
For a man famous in his own lifetime , there is little documentary evidence for Shakespeares life and times .
The actor Mark Rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving First Folios will be on display including those belonging to the British and Bodleian libraries , and a tattered copy recently discovered in France .
The general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare .
Hearing a click off a salmon is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does .
Hearing that subtle click is harder if theres a lot of noise around you .
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 individual ships as they passed through Haro Strait , in Washington State .
The two-year study captured the sounds made by 12 different types of vessel , including cruise ships , container ships and military vehicles , that passed through the strait about 20 times a day .
Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels , equivalent to 111 decibels through the air about the sound of a loud rock concert .
Whales are not usually located right next to ships and so would be subjected to noise of about 60 to 90 decibels around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner .
Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies .
Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise intensity by half .
Under the same conditions , a quarter of women pressed the shock button .
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities is one of a surprising few to tackle the question of why most of us nd it so hard to do nothing .
The only rules were they had to stay seated and not fall asleep .
On average , they did not enjoy the experience .
To the researchers surprise , 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks , as did six of 24 women .
Imagine the setup a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock , and they are told to just sit there and entertain themselves with their thoughts , she said .
Enter a department store and you will be watched .
Its that you need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and , in the past , that when those characteristics are present , this is what a person tends to do .
If it sounds familiar , its because the online world has been using techniques like these for years .
If I just showed you a shot of someones body you could probably tell me what gender they are .
We allow this to happen online so why not of ine ?
Among 6- to 7-year-olds , who have grown up with YouTube , Spotify music streaming and online television , the average DQ score was 98 , higher than for those aged between 45 and 49 , who scored an average of 96 .
The most remarkable change is in time spent talking on the phone .
For those aged 12 to 15 , phone calls account for just 3 % of time spent communicating through any device .
For all adults , this rises to 20 % and , for young adults , it is still three times as high at 9 % .
Away from their phones , 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media , too .
They spend 20 % of their time viewing short video clips , for example on YouTube , or news clips distributed via Facebook and other social sites .
The rest of their viewing is shared between DVDs , streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes .
From 2006 to 2008 , Duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in Spain .
He spent two months in prison before being bailed for 50,000 .
More than 25,000 kilos of dead sh were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds , chicks , eggs and nests were killed or destroyed .
It was Spain &apos;s worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost 90m .
&quot; There are riches here , riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants , said Vicente Fernandez Guerrero , secretary-general of Innovation , Industry and Energy for Andalucia .
People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times , after all .
The best technology in the world will be used here , Fernandez insisted .
For his part , Carlos Davila , who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana , was also alarmed at the proposal .
This is a very , very bad idea indeed , he told me .
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago .
After the disaster , Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it , he added .
It shows the power of Star Wars that , although they were disappointing , the prequels still managed to make a lot of money , said Rosser .
We may not yet be living in an age of ying cars , as predicted in the 1985 lm Back to the Future II , but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched .
Communication between riders and drivers , between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era , according to Allan Clelland , an expert on transportation technology .
According to the study , those born in the 1990s are making 4 % fewer car trips and travelling 18 % fewer miles per year , on average , than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives .
Companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling .
Automation Driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace .
To see what driverless cars might look like in action , go to the video at : vimeo.com / 37751380 .
The Mesolithic man , who lived in Spain around 7,000 years ago , had an unusual mix of blue eyes , black or brown hair and dark skin , according to analyses of his genetic make-up .
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006 .
This guy had to be darker than any modern European , but we dont know how dark , the scientist said .
You see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin .
You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour , Lalueza-Fox said .
The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related .
But , in 2013 , one of the mothers , who is 33 and unemployed , sued her ex-partner for maintenance for her daughter .
A DNA test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby .
Its four years later : you can understand she doesnt want to give up her baby .
But , whatever happens , someone wont be happy .
Karabo Ngidi , a lawyer with the centre , said Whats going to happen must be in the best interests of the children .
In 1995 , two mothers were awarded damages after their sons , born in 1989 , were accidentally switched at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born .
Tourist numbers are down 80 % this year , said Mayor Maria Kakali , in an of ce in the village where she grew up , home to around 200 people .
If we have to pay a tax of 23 % , Im sorry to say it but we will all die on the island , says Kakali .
It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors , compared with tens of thousands on an island such as Rhodes .
The truth is the government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean , she said , so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament , to tell them : There is still life in these islands .
The age of the big British summer music festival , including Glastonbury , is drawing to a close , according to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith .
That is a big , big problem in our industry .
And , we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts the likes of the Rolling Stones , Muse , even the Arctic Monkeys that can headline .
There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014 , he said , and there is no way they can all continue .
He didnt want to risk leaving the US it was him , not Elvis , said Goldsmith .
Freddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer , the best live performer weve ever had .
Were not producing a new generation of this kind of act .
Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was ten years ago .
So , with no big acts to headline , there are no big shows .
What is it like to look at the very last of something ?
If he does not mate successfully soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya , there will be no more of their kind , male or female , born anywhere .
Apart from these three animals , there are only two other northern white rhinos in the world , both in zoos , both female .
His eye is a sad black dot in his massive wrinkled face as he wanders the reserve with his guards .
It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone and leathery esh , a head that expresses pure strength .
Human beings we always kill the things we love .
But the same people who painted such sensitive portraits of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them off .
The northern white rhino is the rarest species of African rhino .
There are far greater numbers of southern white rhinos and black rhinos .
From 2007 , when just 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa , the killings have grown horri cally .
In 2014 , 1,215 rhinos were slaughtered for their horns in South Africa .
In 2006 , the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe sh in their natural environment .
Although it allows you to stay underwater for longer , you have to plan your whole day around it .
You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you you cant be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in .
It was during a nal-year project for his product design degree at the University of Limerick that Redmond produced the Express Dive .
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be re lled .
Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel .
The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater , he says .
A lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day , every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life , including people that I dont really have a relationship with , she said .
One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world , she said .
I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else .
He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed .
And with no friends accounts to follow online , he has to pick up the phone and call them , something hes come to de nitely enjoy .
Lauren Raskauskas , 22 , Naples , Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a pretty private person .
She recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago after realizing she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing .
He claims that he hasnt seen any effect at this point .
Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook , they make sure to send him a text message , too , he said .
His billing , The Beale Street Blues Boy , was shortened to Blues Boy King and thence to BB .
But he would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt .
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill : I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style , like Elmore James and Booker White .
About a year and a half ago , he said in 1969 , all of a sudden , kids started coming up to me saying , Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world .
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette rms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers .
Numbers who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down , West said .
Weve only been tracking vaping for just over a year , so its a short time period , but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes .
Our customers are still very happy with the product , and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes .
They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective .
There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors , he said .
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in , Baghdad is the worst and London , Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35 , according to international research into quality of life .
German-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study , with Vienna joined by Zurich , Munich , Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven .
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad , said Hartlauer .
We also have terri c public transport , with the underground working 24 hours at weekends , and it only costs 1 per trip .
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped de ne Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe .
Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun .
We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process ( including how much they take home from tips and whether its fair ) and what would improve it for them .
Rodri , 37 , London : Around 50 % of a waiters income is tips Average tips : 60 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... the US Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015 .
However , you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains .
I can average around 60 in tips per shift but , on a good night , this goes up to over 100 and , on a poor night , its around 40 .
Elle , 22 , Edinburgh : We never know whether its fair Average tips : 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France I work three jobs , all on part-time zero-hours contracts , in catering and hospitality .
In restaurants , because a lot of customers add tips through card payments , the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped so we dont know whether were getting our fair share or not .
Its really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers .
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips .
I make around 20 a shift but would only be given 10-15 of that money .
I really rely on tips because I am only paid 7 an hour .
Tom , Manchester : A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips : 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy Where I used to work , oor staff kept 80 % of cash tips and 40 % of card tips .
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift ; maybe around 40 , 20 from card tips .
They have got tipping right in Italy , where people dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so , if they get a meal for 19 , they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change .
A more open and connected world is a better world .
You wont be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend : you already know theyre dating someone else from the romantic sel es .
It doesnt necessarily mean we see them the same way .
Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group .
An overwhelming majority of 91 % post a photo of themselves , 71 % post the city or town where they live , up from 61 % , more than half give email addresses and a fth give their phone number .
The data and analytics available to you are extraordinary .
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Though the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution , organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook .
5 Facebook makes news , breaks news and decides what is news Roughly 71 % of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63 % of users overall , according to the Pew Research Center .
And 39 % are connected to people they have never met in person .
We may as well get used to it , said David Kirkpatrick , author of The Facebook Effect .
If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25 % , there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished , according to the UN .
Each year , 1.3bn tonnes of food , about a third of all that is produced , is wasted , including about 45 % of all fruit and vegetables , 35 % of sh and seafood , 30 % of cereals , 20 % of dairy products and 20 % of meat .
In the developing world , food waste is virtually non-existent , says Robert van Otterdijk , coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Save Food programme .
Food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food .
The foods most commonly found in British bins are bread , vegetables , fruit and milk .
By percentage , the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads , of which consumers throw away 38 % ( 64,000 tonnes ) of all they buy .
Cockrell , a former Wall Street worker turned therapist , spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street , as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people .
Many of the extremely wealthy the 1 % of the 1 % feel that their problems are really not problems .
There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich .
And , then , there is the isolation being in the 1 % , it turns out , can be lonely .
The media , she said , is partly to blame for making the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed .
Since the 2008 nancial crisis , the income gap has expanded and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy , Cockrell said .
Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means , I think that is dif cult , said Cockrell .
Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret .
There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment , said Traeger-Muney .
If you are part of the 1 % , you still have problems and they are legitimate to you .
Money is not the only thing that de nes you , he said .
Is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream ?
Apple is good at mainstreaming products but its not that good .
Apple , and the record industry , cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand , one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker .
A century ago , Venice one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world used to ood around ten times a year .
I manage one minute and 12 seconds .
At a pool in Bristol , she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater .
I asked how she did it : very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive , then a big , deep breath before diving in .
At least , it doesnt if youre breath-holding on land .
When you breathe in , youre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm , pulling it at so that the volume of your chest increases and air is drawn into your lungs .
Steve Deace , a prominent Iowa conservative , said that Trumps antics are both a good and a bad thing .
As the pollster notes : Trump says what theyre thinking and , the more outrageous he is , the more they agree with him .
Sometimes life just isnt fair .
In fact , he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since .
The website ATMInventor.com concludes : Who invented the idea of an ATM ?
In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century , it states : In the 1960s , James Goodfellow ( 1937- ) invented the cash-dispensing automatic teller machine ( ATM ) or cashpoint .
So after all these years , Goodfellow nally nds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird ( the television ) , Alan Turing ( the Turing machine ) , Sir Frank Whittle ( the jet engine ) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee ( the World Wide Web ) .
British people think the top 1 % wealthiest households own 59 % of their countrys wealth , when they actually only own 23 % .
Americans think that 33 % of their population are immigrants , when in fact it is only 14 % .
In Britain , people think that an extraordinary 43 % of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents , rather than the actual 14 % .
The worst case is Saudi Arabia , where people think only 28 % are , when 71 % are .
Britons think it is 44 % , when it is actually nearly half as much again 62 % are either overweight or obese .
And , in many ways , it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study .
Thats 65 litres of clean , drinkable water that were infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day sometimes more than once .
The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore , as California enters another summer of drought .
Skip a few showers , put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria ourish a little , would you ?
The conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds .
For the older teenagers , it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later .
Kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms .
Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups , he says : Between 14 and 24 , its more than two hours .
For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35 , its about an hour and a half .
Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive consequences .
The positive side of this is peoples performance , mood and health will improve .
Its very uplifting in a way because its a solution that will make people less ill , and happier and better at what they do .
A later start to the day for many , says Kelley , is something that would bene t everyone , particularly families .
And , yes , he says he nds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger .
Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked , in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is .
One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks .
If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood , it can deliver from that base .
You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance .
The Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours , Singh said .
Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and , thus , standards are much higher .
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the East Hampton Food Pantry , she says , which is just one of several food pantries in the town .
Vicki Littman , chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry , which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015 , says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing .
Housing is , by far , the biggest cost in the Hamptons .
Theres certainly a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer , says Cantwell , the son of a sherman father and a house-cleaner mother .
But , the rest of us live here year round .
There are famous and very wealthy people but then you have hard-working and poor people struggling to get by .
Youve got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and shing community of people who lived off the land and the water a real working-class community .
I want to work but theres no work to be done .
Some danced , some posed for photos , some drank , but mostly they just walked and talked football , waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby FanFest big screen .
The trip has not been problem free .
His son , Andrew , had his sunglasses stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach .
And , they have been surprised that many bars are not set up with big screens for the games .
But , like many fans , they said they loved the atmosphere , if not the logistics , of this tournament which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch .
Elsewhere , there has been a glut of goals : 28 in the rst eight games almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010 .
The Globo newspaper listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities .
The worst transport problems were in Natal , where bus drivers have been on strike since 12 June .
But , protests have diminished since the opening day , when small demonstrations took place in several cities , prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray .
Since then , the only security threat has been petty theft and overexcited fans .
But , these days , the golden arches of McDonalds are looking a little tarnished .
Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his rst restaurant in Des Plaines , Illinois , consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries .
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13 % since 2011 , according to food analysts Technomic , while the number of 22-to-37-year- olds visiting has not grown .
To add to the companys problems , McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners , who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys , Smashburger or Fuddruckers .
Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers ?
Ever since it introduced $ 2 items on its dollar menu , it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals , while many consumers complain that service is slower .
Prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US .
McDonalds has a bigger menu than some , with more complicated items its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make .
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger , he said , raising questions about how it could be scaled up .
Faehrmann said the protests had shown Australians wanted sharks protected : Whats amazing is so many people in Australia love sharks .
Anthony Joyce , a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth , said : The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things .
Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans , as no previous cull has solely used drumlines .
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastest-growing population in Australia , rather than a rising number of sharks .
The activity in Western Australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks .
Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it .
All youre going to achieve , I think , is to worry people unnecessarily .

Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it emerged that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts .
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals , including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace , which uses them for its 350 summer workers .
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff 80 % of its workforce on the terms .
Dave Prentis , of the trade union Unison , said : The vast majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice .
The charity National Trust , which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts , said it offered the same pay and bene ts to those workers , pro rata , as full-time staff , but needed some workers to be on a more exible arrangement .
Our properties have told us its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this .
While some employees welcome the exibility of such contracts , for many , zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come , he said .
The institutes gures also suggest that 17 % of employers in the private sector made use of zero- hours contracts , considerably lower than the 34 % of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24 % in the public sector .
Industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels , catering and leisure ( 48 % ) , education ( 35 % ) and healthcare ( 27 % ) .
He gets what all referees hope for every time they referee a match .
A few weeks earlier , Riley , Dunn and another former referee , Peter Jones , made their way to another level-5 match to monitor another referee tipped to progress John Brooks .
A little later , the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is safe to assume these men do not do it for the cash .
How does he feel watching football on TV when a referee gets vilified ?
Riley , as a young referee , went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all .
Riley , as a young referee , went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all .
He also has the support of a sports psychologist , Liam Slack , for regular guidance and an exercise regime to help him handle the 11km he runs during a game .
We are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the field of play , says Riley .
Buildings warm up in a number of different ways .
The Stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it re ects 97 % of the visible light that falls on it .
When the mirror is warmed up , it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space .
You could use this on buildings so you have to spend much less on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnt need it at all .
You could put it on top of shopping malls .
The project is a key plank in Moroccos ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower .
When they are nished , the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Moroccos capital city , Rabat , and generate 580 mega-watts ( MW ) of electricity , enough to power a million homes .
Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020 , with wind and hydro taking the same share each .
Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries , according to the Moroccan solar energy agency ( Masen ) .
We believe that its possible to export energy to Europe but , rst , we would have to build the interconnectors which dont yet exist , said Maha el-Kadiri , a Masen spokeswoman .
In a three-year period , the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million , according to the 2014 digital music report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) .
Easily accessible from smartphones and tablets , subscription services are popular with people looking to try out new music without committing to buying a download or a CD .
Retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they cant get online , says Simon Boydell , spokesman for Marketforce , which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers on its books .
Our clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience .
Each day , they typically spend up to eight hours visiting ve to ten stores , plus another hour or two ling detailed reports on every aspect of their visit .
Shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy .
Im always given a scenario , such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range , but , within that framework , I can often buy whatever I want and keep it .
Her income is typically 30,000 to 40,000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job .
She does , however , nd it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved .
Marketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort , says Boydell .
I wont touch those jobs anymore .
Hannah , a 41-year-old City lawyer , has conducted nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses .
When the Russian capsule opened on to the cool air of Kazakhstan , Kelly said , he smelled a fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area .
He said the message we need to save the planet slightly missed the point : The planet will get better ; its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment .
A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words .
And , each single word lights up many different brain spots .
It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing , reading or possibly even thinking , said Alexander Huth , the rst author on the study .
Per person , that amounted to hearing roughly 25,000 words and more than 3,000 different words as they lay in the scanner .
The atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain .
The same region responds to killed , convicted , murdered and confessed .
On the brains right-hand side , near the top of the head , is one of the brain spots activated by family terms : wife , husband , children , parents .
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings .
One part of the brain , for example , reliably responds to the word top , along with other words that describe clothing .
One of them responds to numbers and measurements , another to buildings and places .
The scientists only scanned ve men and two women , however .
It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases .
Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension thats already there .
Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music .
Theres no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city , says Douville .
Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before , in England .
To avoid the same fate , hes spending money to build a patio .
Lost Loves Douville , though , feels the ban to be a great business opportunity .
The number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar , with our food , but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days were now an option for all those people .
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell , who introduced and pushed the ban , disagrees : The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well , she says .
The owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities .
I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses .
Bar customers are encouraged to come ll out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smoking .
Unworried , Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban .
But it doesnt mean theyre gonna win .
This learned deafness is a real issue , Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose .
We are conditioning ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears .
This gift that we are born with to reach out and hear things hundreds of metres away , all these incredible sounds is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia , he said .
For the past ten years , the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 sites across the US , including Yosemite in California , Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska .
If nding peace and quiet becomes dif cult enough , many , many children will grow up without the experience and I think its a very real problem , he said .
Speaking at the same meeting , Derrick Taff , a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University , described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks , of waterfalls , birdsong and wind , helped people recover from stressful events .
Valter Piscedda , the centre- left mayor of Elmas , a small town near Sardinias capital , Cagliari , wants to pay residents to leave .
This is , above all , an idea born of common sense and experience , he told the Guardian .
And they want to go and gain work experience abroad ; life experience , too .
In Elmas , the scheme has provoked mixed reactions .
The reality is that there is little work here , said Alessandro Macis .
said Consuelo Melis , who works behind the bar in a local café .
The work I can create , as mayor , is temporary .
Robert Mys _ ajek stops dead .
There are now an estimated 1,500 wolves in Poland .
Wolves are along with the brown bear , the lynx and the wolverine Europes last large predator carnivores .
DNA tests have established that Polish wolves are travellers .
Mys _ ajek says only scienti c arguments the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population can save Europes wild carnivores , especially the unpopular wolf .
In 1989 , when the communists relinquished power , Poland had only one motorway .
The Environment Minister , Jan Szyszko , makes no secret of being a hunter .
It is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction .
Tom Sanders , a professor of nutrition at Kings College London , said the research did show some differences .
The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world more than ever before which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit , vegetables and cereals .
Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases , including cardiovascular diseases , neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers .
The researchers found much higher levels of cadmium , a toxic metal , in conventional crops .
A further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates , soil types and crop varieties , and not from organic farming , though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences .
Browning said : This research backs up what people think about organic food .
In other countries , there have long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming .
The canoe is our island , the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader , Pittman says .
On a canoe , you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars , the moon , the sun and the birds .
The of cial title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage and it is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Oceania Regional Of ce and ve Paci c Island countries : Samoa , Tonga , New Zealand , the Cook Islands and Fiji .
The main goal of the 6,000-nautical-mile ( 11,000km ) trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress .
According to the IUCN , as of 2013 , the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take .
And the effects of climate change were already beginning to impact seriously on Paci c Islanders .
I work hard and am good at my job but , when PizzaExpress thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hard-earned tips left on a card , I get upset .
PizzaExpress joins restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi in siphoning off 8 % of the tips paid by card but other chains deduct even more .
Cafe _ Rouge , Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10 % , as do Strada and Giraffe , which is owned by Tesco .
Almost 6,000 people have so far signed Unites online petition .
One waiter , who doesnt work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain , said that at least a third of his income is from tips .
The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change .
4C would likely be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous , Sherwood said .
For example , it would make life difficult , if not impossible , in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet , with sea levels rising by many metres as a result .
When water evaporates from the oceans , the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight ; or , it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds .
Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect , said Sherwood .
But what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models which predict less warming , not those that predict more .
Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam , the proportion has been 20 % .
Amin , 61 , from rural Bangladesh , has seen his livelihood gradually decline , due to his own and his wifes illnesses , the cost of his sons marriage , the death of his father and loss of goods such as shing nets .
Lovemore , 74 , from Zimbabwe , has become one of the poorest people in his village .
He recently lost his job as a car-park attendant due to ill health and had to take in his ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters .
The second is education , from early childhood to the start of work , to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty .
Even Nigeria , with its oil wealth , spends only $ 650 per capita , Shepherd said .
We Can Do It is not a female beer but a beer brewed by women that anyone can drink , she says .
One weekend they concocted the recipe and the next they brewed 1,600 litres .
This is not a beer that is aimed at women its our hoppiest brew , says Thomas Bingebo , the head brewer at Ocean .
FemAle has already been approached by other breweries asking if they can brew new beers with them .
From all across Rwanda , and even parts of neighbouring Burundi , people ock to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza ( Sweet Dreams ) .
Here , at the central African countrys rst ice- cream parlour , customers can buy scoops in sweet cream , passion fruit , strawberry and pineapple avours .
Ice cream is important , she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering .
True to Inzozi Nzizas motto , the shop can certainly make dreams come true .
Its something uniting people here , Kalisa Migendo , a 24-year-old agriculture student , says .
Inzozi Nziza was opened by the theatre director Odile Gakire Katese .
The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women , some survivors of the 1994 genocide , during which almost a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed .
When Im drumming with them , it gives me power because were still alive and survivors .
Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills , he wrote .
What we did was to look at a set of current London taxi drivers and a set of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years , said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers , head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College London , who is an author of the study .
The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities , says Spiers .
Ultimately , McKinlay believes , its essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation .
La Premiere chose qu &apos;on regarde ( The First Thing We Look At ) by Grégoire Delacourt tells the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the book &apos;s lead male character thinks it is Johansson herself .
In the novel , the model &apos;s looks mean that men see her only as a sex object , while women are jealous of her .
She has a series of adventures as Johansson until she is eventually found out and , in the end , dies in a car crash .
Delacourt has become one of Frances best-loved authors ; his previous novel , My List of Desires , was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a lm .
I wrote a real love story and a homage to feminine beauty , especially interior beauty .
I thought she might send me owers as it was a declaration of love for her , but she didnt understand , Delacourt said .
All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of tness : stamina , handgrip strength and lower-body power .
The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular tness , muscle strength and ability to accelerate , all of which predict how good someone is at sport , in which such attributes are vital .
Those born in October were almost as t , scoring highest for strength and coming third for power , with December children close behind .
The gap in physical prowess between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide .
This is , potentially , a huge physical advantage , said Sandercock .
Such gaps could ultimately decide who became a top-level athlete because , as the paper says , selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individuals physical performance .
The ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage they are already known to have an academic advantage and , now , they also appear to be better equipped for sport , too .
Children that get a high-quality rst experience , which develops their physical literacy , are those that will have greater agility , balance and coordination , and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up , he said .
As soon as the children at one primary school in Stirling hear the words daily mile , they down their pencils and head out of the classroom to start running laps around the school eld .
For three-and-a-half years , all pupils at St Ninians Primary have walked or run a mile each day .
The thought of children across the country running every day because of something weve done is phenomenal .
In Stirling alone , 30 schools have already started or are to start the daily mile .
The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it ; otherwise , you couldnt sustain it .
At St Ninians , teachers take their pupils out of lessons on to a specially built circuit around the schools playing eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that days timetable .
The extent of the bene ts have yet to be determined but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for quantitative evidence of the physical , cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile .
Paralympian , Tanni Grey-Thompson , chair of ukactive , the UKs leading not-for-pro t health body for physical activity , said : All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day , whether in a lesson , on the walk to school or in the playground .
We know sitting still kills ; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life .
The Scottish government is also supportive .
In what Mason called the rst city-scale genetic pro le ever , his team found meningitis at Times Square , a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan .
All around the subway , bacteria associated with cheeses brie , cheddar , parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza turned up .
The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more localized to midtown Manhattan and the nancial district , and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the nancial district and Bay Ridge .
Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea , both benign and bad E.coli ( mostly benign ) , and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city .
He said he hoped the research would provide a baseline of research for health of cials and geneticists , and could help health of cials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens .
The yes campaign scored four big successes , winning 53 % of the vote in Scotlands largest city , Glasgow , 57 % in Dundee and 51 % in North Lanarkshire .
We have heard the voice of Scotland and , now , the millions of voices of England must be heard , he said .
Ed Miliband , the Labour leader , said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change .
We know our country needs to change in the way it is governed and we know our country needs to change in who it is governed for .
Theyve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years .
We will continue to ght with the facts because the facts are on our side , he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts .
Already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a naturalistic setting .
SeaWorlds shares , which were worth $ 39 in 2013 , were changing hands for just under $ 18 in August 2015 .
Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeares life , argues Paul Edmondson , the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust .
But Stratford is where he bought land and property , where he kept his library , where he lived and read and thought .
The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford , the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world , will be marked across Britain and the globe .
Macbeth will open in Singapore , Romeo and Juliet in Brussels .
In London , they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema , one screen to showcase each of Shakespeares plays , along the South Bank .
The National Theatre , the Royal Shakespeare Company and virtually every other theatre production company in the country will be marking the anniversary .
There will also be hundreds of lectures , recitals , international academic conferences , lms , concerts , operas and major exhibitions .
For a man famous in his own lifetime , there is little documentary evidence for Shakespeares life and times .
The actor Mark Rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving First Folios will be on display including those belonging to the British and Bodleian libraries , and a tattered copy recently discovered in France .
The general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare .
Hearing a click off a salmon is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does .
Hearing that subtle click is harder if theres a lot of noise around you .
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 individual ships as they passed through Haro Strait , in Washington State .
The two-year study captured the sounds made by 12 different types of vessel , including cruise ships , container ships and military vehicles , that passed through the strait about 20 times a day .
Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels , equivalent to 111 decibels through the air about the sound of a loud rock concert .
Whales are not usually located right next to ships and so would be subjected to noise of about 60 to 90 decibels around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner .
Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies .
Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise intensity by half .
Under the same conditions , a quarter of women pressed the shock button .
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities is one of a surprising few to tackle the question of why most of us nd it so hard to do nothing .
The only rules were they had to stay seated and not fall asleep .
On average , they did not enjoy the experience .
To the researchers surprise , 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks , as did six of 24 women .
Imagine the setup a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock , and they are told to just sit there and entertain themselves with their thoughts , she said .
Enter a department store and you will be watched .
Its that you need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and , in the past , that when those characteristics are present , this is what a person tends to do .
If it sounds familiar , its because the online world has been using techniques like these for years .
If I just showed you a shot of someones body you could probably tell me what gender they are .
We allow this to happen online so why not of ine ?
Among 6- to 7-year-olds , who have grown up with YouTube , Spotify music streaming and online television , the average DQ score was 98 , higher than for those aged between 45 and 49 , who scored an average of 96 .
The most remarkable change is in time spent talking on the phone .
For those aged 12 to 15 , phone calls account for just 3 % of time spent communicating through any device .
For all adults , this rises to 20 % and , for young adults , it is still three times as high at 9 % .
Away from their phones , 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media , too .
They spend 20 % of their time viewing short video clips , for example on YouTube , or news clips distributed via Facebook and other social sites .
The rest of their viewing is shared between DVDs , streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes .
From 2006 to 2008 , Duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in Spain .
He spent two months in prison before being bailed for 50,000 .
More than 25,000 kilos of dead sh were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds , chicks , eggs and nests were killed or destroyed .
It was Spains &apos; worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost 90m .
There are riches here , riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants , said Vicente Fernandez Guerrero , secretary-general of Innovation , Industry and Energy for Andalucia .
People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times , after all .
The best technology in the world will be used here , Fernandez insisted .
For his part , Carlos Davila , who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana , was also alarmed at the proposal .
This is a very , very bad idea indeed , he told me .
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago .
After the disaster , Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it , he added .
It shows the power of Star Wars that , although they were disappointing , the prequels still managed to make a lot of money , said Rosser .
We may not yet be living in an age of ying cars , as predicted in the 1985 lm Back to the Future II , but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched .
Communication between riders and drivers , between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era , according to Allan Clelland , an expert on transportation technology .
According to the study , those born in the 1990s are making 4 % fewer car trips and travelling 18 % fewer miles per year , on average , than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives .
Companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling .
Automation Driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace .

The Mesolithic man , who lived in Spain around 7,000 years ago , had an unusual mix of blue eyes , black or brown hair and dark skin , according to analyses of his genetic make-up .
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006 .
This guy had to be darker than any modern European , but we dont know how dark , the scientist said .
You see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin .
You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour , Lalueza-Fox said .
The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related .
But , in 2013 , one of the mothers , who is 33 and unemployed , sued her ex-partner for maintenance for her daughter .
A DNA test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby .
Its four years later : you can understand she doesnt want to give up her baby .
But , whatever happens , someone wont be happy .
Karabo Ngidi , a lawyer with the centre , said Whats going to happen must be in the best interests of the children .
In 1995 , two mothers were awarded damages after their sons , born in 1989 , were accidentally switched at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born .
Tourist numbers are down 80 % this year , said Mayor Maria Kakali , in an of ce in the village where she grew up , home to around 200 people .
If we have to pay a tax of 23 % , Im sorry to say it but we will all die on the island , says Kakali .
It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors , compared with tens of thousands on an island such as Rhodes .
The truth is the government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean , she said , so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament , to tell them : There is still life in these islands .
The age of the big British summer music festival , including Glastonbury , is drawing to a close , according to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith .
That is a big , big problem in our industry .
And , we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts the likes of the Rolling Stones , Muse , even the Arctic Monkeys that can headline .
There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014 , he said , and there is no way they can all continue .
He didnt want to risk leaving the US it was him , not Elvis , said Goldsmith .
Freddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer , the best live performer weve ever had .
Were not producing a new generation of this kind of act .
Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was ten years ago .
So , with no big acts to headline , there are no big shows .
What is it like to look at the very last of something ?
If he does not mate successfully soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya , there will be no more of their kind , male or female , born anywhere .
Apart from these three animals , there are only two other northern white rhinos in the world , both in zoos , both female .
His eye is a sad black dot in his massive wrinkled face as he wanders the reserve with his guards .
It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone and leathery esh , a head that expresses pure strength .
Human beings we always kill the things we love .
But the same people who painted such sensitive portraits of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them off .
The northern white rhino is the rarest species of African rhino .
There are far greater numbers of southern white rhinos and black rhinos .
From 2007 , when just 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa , the killings have grown horri cally .
In 2014 , 1,215 rhinos were slaughtered for their horns in South Africa .
In 2006 , the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe sh in their natural environment .
Although it allows you to stay underwater for longer , you have to plan your whole day around it .
You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you you cant be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in .
It was during a nal-year project for his product design degree at the University of Limerick that Redmond produced the Express Dive .
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be re lled .
Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel .
The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater , he says .
A lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day , every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life , including people that I dont really have a relationship with , she said .
One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world , she said .
I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else .
He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed .
And with no friends accounts to follow online , he has to pick up the phone and call them , something hes come to de nitely enjoy .
Lauren Raskauskas , 22 , Naples , Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a pretty private person .
She recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago after realizing she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing .
He claims that he hasnt seen any effect at this point .
Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook , they make sure to send him a text message , too , he said .
His billing , The Beale Street Blues Boy , was shortened to Blues Boy King and thence to BB .
But he would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt .
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill : I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style , like Elmore James and Booker White .
About a year and a half ago , he said in 1969 , all of a sudden , kids started coming up to me saying , Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world .
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette rms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers .
Numbers who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down , West said .
Weve only been tracking vaping for just over a year , so its a short time period , but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes .
Our customers are still very happy with the product , and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes .
They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective .
There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors , he said .
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in , Baghdad is the worst and London , Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35 , according to international research into quality of life .
German-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study , with Vienna joined by Zurich , Munich , Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven .
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad , said Hartlauer .
We also have terri c public transport , with the underground working 24 hours at weekends , and it only costs 1 per trip .
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped de ne Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe .
Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun .
We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process ( including how much they take home from tips and whether its fair ) and what would improve it for them .
Rodri , 37 , London : Around 50 % of a waiters income is tips Average tips : 60 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... the US Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015 .
However , you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains .
I can average around 60 in tips per shift but , on a good night , this goes up to over 100 and , on a poor night , its around 40 .
Elle , 22 , Edinburgh : We never know whether its fair Average tips : 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France I work three jobs , all on part-time zero-hours contracts , in catering and hospitality .
In restaurants , because a lot of customers add tips through card payments , the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped so we dont know whether were getting our fair share or not .
Its really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers .
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips .
I make around 20 a shift but would only be given 10-15 of that money .
I really rely on tips because I am only paid 7 an hour .
Tom , Manchester : A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips : 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy Where I used to work , oor staff kept 80 % of cash tips and 40 % of card tips .
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift ; maybe around 40 , 20 from card tips .
They have got tipping right in Italy , where people dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so , if they get a meal for 19 , they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change .
A more open and connected world is a better world .
You wont be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend : you already know theyre dating someone else from the romantic sel es .
It doesnt necessarily mean we see them the same way .
Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group .
An overwhelming majority of 91 % post a photo of themselves , 71 % post the city or town where they live , up from 61 % , more than half give email addresses and a fth give their phone number .
The data and analytics available to you are extraordinary .
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Though the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution , organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook .
5 Facebook makes news , breaks news and decides what is news Roughly 71 % of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63 % of users overall , according to the Pew Research Center .
And 39 % are connected to people they have never met in person .
We may as well get used to it , said David Kirkpatrick , author of The Facebook Effect .
If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25 % , there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished , according to the UN .
Each year , 1.3bn tonnes of food , about a third of all that is produced , is wasted , including about 45 % of all fruit and vegetables , 35 % of sh and seafood , 30 % of cereals , 20 % of dairy products and 20 % of meat .
In the developing world , food waste is virtually non-existent , says Robert van Otterdijk , coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Save Food programme .
Food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food .
The foods most commonly found in British bins are bread , vegetables , fruit and milk .
By percentage , the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads , of which consumers throw away 38 % ( 64,000 tonnes ) of all they buy .
Cockrell , a former Wall Street worker turned therapist , spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street , as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people .
Many of the extremely wealthy the 1 % of the 1 % feel that their problems are really not problems .
There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich .
And , then , there is the isolation being in the 1 % , it turns out , can be lonely .
The media , she said , is partly to blame for making the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed .
Since the 2008 nancial crisis , the income gap has expanded and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy , Cockrell said .
Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means , I think that is dif cult , said Cockrell .
Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret .
There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment , said Traeger-Muney .
If you are part of the 1 % , you still have problems and they are legitimate to you .
Money is not the only thing that de nes you , he said .
Is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream ?
Apple is good at mainstreaming products but its not that good .
Apple , and the record industry , cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand , one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker .
A century ago , Venice one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world used to ood around ten times a year .
I manage one minute and 12 seconds .
At a pool in Bristol , she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater .
I asked how she did it : very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive , then a big , deep breath before diving in .
At least , it doesnt if youre breath-holding on land .
When you breathe in , youre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm , pulling it at so that the volume of your chest increases and air is drawn into your lungs .
Steve Deace , a prominent Iowa conservative , said that Trumps antics are both a good and a bad thing .
As the pollster notes : Trump says what theyre thinking and , the more outrageous he is , the more they agree with him .
Sometimes life just isnt fair .
In fact , he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since .
The website ATMInventor.com concludes : Who invented the idea of an ATM ?
In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century , it states : In the 1960s , James Goodfellow ( 1937- ) invented the cash-dispensing automatic teller machine ( ATM ) or cashpoint .
So after all these years , Goodfellow nally nds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird ( the television ) , Alan Turing ( the Turing machine ) , Sir Frank Whittle ( the jet engine ) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee ( the World Wide Web ) .
British people think the top 1 % wealthiest households own 59 % of their countrys wealth , when they actually only own 23 % .
Americans think that 33 % of their population are immigrants , when in fact it is only 14 % .
In Britain , people think that an extraordinary 43 % of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents , rather than the actual 14 % .
The worst case is Saudi Arabia , where people think only 28 % are , when 71 % are .
Britons think it is 44 % , when it is actually nearly half as much again 62 % are either overweight or obese .
And , in many ways , it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study .
Thats 65 litres of clean , drinkable water that were infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day sometimes more than once .
The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore , as California enters another summer of drought .
Skip a few showers , put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria ourish a little , would you ?
The conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds .
For the older teenagers , it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later .
Kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms .
Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups , he says : Between 14 and 24 , its more than two hours .
For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35 , its about an hour and a half .
Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive consequences .
The positive side of this is peoples performance , mood and health will improve .
Its very uplifting in a way because its a solution that will make people less ill , and happier and better at what they do .
A later start to the day for many , says Kelley , is something that would bene t everyone , particularly families .
And , yes , he says he nds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger .
Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked , in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is .
One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks .
If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood , it can deliver from that base .
You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance .
The Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours , Singh said .
Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and , thus , standards are much higher .
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the East Hampton Food Pantry , she says , which is just one of several food pantries in the town .
Vicki Littman , chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry , which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015 , says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing .
Housing is , by far , the biggest cost in the Hamptons .
Theres certainly a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer , says Cantwell , the son of a sherman father and a house-cleaner mother .
But , the rest of us live here year round .
There are famous and very wealthy people but then you have hard-working and poor people struggling to get by .
Youve got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and shing community of people who lived off the land and the water a real working-class community .
I want to work but theres no work to be done .
Some danced , some posed for photos , some drank , but mostly they just walked and talked football , waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby FanFest big screen .
The trip has not been problem free .
His son , Andrew , had his sunglasses stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach .
And , they have been surprised that many bars are not set up with big screens for the games .
But , like many fans , they said they loved the atmosphere , if not the logistics , of this tournament which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch .
Elsewhere , there has been a glut of goals : 28 in the rst eight games almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010 .
The Globo newspaper listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities .
The worst transport problems were in Natal , where bus drivers have been on strike since 12 June .
But , protests have diminished since the opening day , when small demonstrations took place in several cities , prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray .
Since then , the only security threat has been petty theft and overexcited fans .
But , these days , the golden arches of McDonalds are looking a little tarnished .
Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his rst restaurant in Des Plaines , Illinois , consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries .
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13 % since 2011 , according to food analysts Technomic , while the number of 22-to-37-year- olds visiting has not grown .
To add to the companys problems , McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners , who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys , Smashburger or Fuddruckers .
Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers ?
Ever since it introduced $ 2 items on its dollar menu , it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals , while many consumers complain that service is slower .
Prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US .
McDonalds has a bigger menu than some , with more complicated items its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make .
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger , he said , raising questions about how it could be scaled up .
Faehrmann said the protests had shown Australians wanted sharks protected : Whats amazing is so many people in Australia love sharks .
Anthony Joyce , a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth , said : The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things .
Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans , as no previous cull has solely used drumlines .
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastest-growing population in Australia , rather than a rising number of sharks .
The activity in Western Australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks .
Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it .
All youre going to achieve , I think , is to worry people unnecessarily .

Typically , pilots must y beside the power line , sometimes as little as 20 feet away and just 30 feet off the ground .
Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it emerged that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts .
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals , including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace , which uses them for its 350 summer workers .
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff 80 % of its workforce on the terms .
Dave Prentis , of the trade union Unison , said : The vast majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice .
The charity National Trust , which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts , said it offered the same pay and bene ts to those workers , pro rata , as full-time staff , but needed some workers to be on a more exible arrangement .
Our properties have told us its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this .
While some employees welcome the exibility of such contracts , for many , zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come , he said .
The institutes gures also suggest that 17 % of employers in the private sector made use of zero- hours contracts , considerably lower than the 34 % of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24 % in the public sector .
Industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels , catering and leisure ( 48 % ) , education ( 35 % ) and healthcare ( 27 % ) .
He gets what all referees hope for every time they referee a match .
A few weeks earlier , Riley , Dunn and another former referee , Peter Jones , made their way to another level-5 match to monitor another referee tipped to progress John Brooks .
A little later , the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is safe to assume these men do not do it for the cash .
How does he feel watching football on TV when a referee gets vilified ?
Riley , as a young referee , went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all .
Riley , as a young referee , went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all .
He also has the support of a sports psychologist , Liam Slack , for regular guidance and an exercise regime to help him handle the 11km he runs during a game .
We are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the field of play , says Riley .
Buildings warm up in a number of different ways .
The Stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it re ects 97 % of the visible light that falls on it .
When the mirror is warmed up , it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space .
You could use this on buildings so you have to spend much less on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnt need it at all .
You could put it on top of shopping malls .
The project is a key plank in Moroccos ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower .
When they are nished , the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Moroccos capital city , Rabat , and generate 580 mega-watts ( MW ) of electricity , enough to power a million homes .
Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020 , with wind and hydro taking the same share each .
Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries , according to the Moroccan solar energy agency ( Masen ) .
We believe that its possible to export energy to Europe but , rst , we would have to build the interconnectors which dont yet exist , said Maha el-Kadiri , a Masen spokeswoman .
In a three-year period , the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million , according to the 2014 digital music report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) .
Easily accessible from smartphones and tablets , subscription services are popular with people looking to try out new music without committing to buying a download or a CD .
Retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they cant get online , says Simon Boydell , spokesman for Marketforce , which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers on its books .
Our clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience .
Each day , they typically spend up to eight hours visiting ve to ten stores , plus another hour or two ling detailed reports on every aspect of their visit .
Shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy .
Im always given a scenario , such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range , but , within that framework , I can often buy whatever I want and keep it .
Her income is typically 30,000 to 40,000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job .
She does , however , nd it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved .
Marketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort , says Boydell .
I wont touch those jobs anymore .
Hannah , a 41-year-old City lawyer , has conducted nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses .
When the Russian capsule opened on to the cool air of Kazakhstan , Kelly said , he smelled a fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area .
He said the message we need to save the planet slightly missed the point : The planet will get better ; its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment .
A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words .
And , each single word lights up many different brain spots .
It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing , reading or possibly even thinking , said Alexander Huth , the rst author on the study .
Per person , that amounted to hearing roughly 25,000 words and more than 3,000 different words as they lay in the scanner .
The atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain .
The same region responds to killed , convicted , murdered and confessed .
On the brains right-hand side , near the top of the head , is one of the brain spots activated by family terms : wife , husband , children , parents .
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings .
One part of the brain , for example , reliably responds to the word top , along with other words that describe clothing .
One of them responds to numbers and measurements , another to buildings and places .
The scientists only scanned ve men and two women , however .
It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases .
Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension thats already there .
Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music .
Theres no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city , says Douville .
Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before , in England .
To avoid the same fate , hes spending money to build a patio .
Lost Loves Douville , though , feels the ban to be a great business opportunity .
The number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar , with our food , but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days were now an option for all those people .
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell , who introduced and pushed the ban , disagrees : The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well , she says .
The owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities .
I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses .
Bar customers are encouraged to come ll out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smoking .
Unworried , Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban .
But it doesnt mean theyre gonna win .
This learned deafness is a real issue , Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose .
We are conditioning ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears .
This gift that we are born with to reach out and hear things hundreds of metres away , all these incredible sounds is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia , he said .
For the past ten years , the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 sites across the US , including Yosemite in California , Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska .
If nding peace and quiet becomes dif cult enough , many , many children will grow up without the experience and I think its a very real problem , he said .
Speaking at the same meeting , Derrick Taff , a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University , described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks , of waterfalls , birdsong and wind , helped people recover from stressful events .
Valter Piscedda , the centre- left mayor of Elmas , a small town near Sardinias capital , Cagliari , wants to pay residents to leave .
This is , above all , an idea born of common sense and experience , he told the Guardian .
And they want to go and gain work experience abroad ; life experience , too .
In Elmas , the scheme has provoked mixed reactions .
The reality is that there is little work here , said Alessandro Macis .
said Consuelo Melis , who works behind the bar in a local café .
The work I can create , as mayor , is temporary .
Robert Mys _ ajek stops dead .
There are now an estimated 1,500 wolves in Poland .
Wolves are along with the brown bear , the lynx and the wolverine Europes last large predator carnivores .
DNA tests have established that Polish wolves are travellers .
Mys _ ajek says only scienti c arguments the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population can save Europes wild carnivores , especially the unpopular wolf .
In 1989 , when the communists relinquished power , Poland had only one motorway .
The Environment Minister , Jan Szyszko , makes no secret of being a hunter .
It is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction .
Tom Sanders , a professor of nutrition at Kings College London , said the research did show some differences .
The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world more than ever before which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit , vegetables and cereals .
Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases , including cardiovascular diseases , neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers .
The researchers found much higher levels of cadmium , a toxic metal , in conventional crops .
A further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates , soil types and crop varieties , and not from organic farming , though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences .
Browning said : This research backs up what people think about organic food .
In other countries , there have long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming .
The canoe is our island , the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader , Pittman says .
On a canoe , you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars , the moon , the sun and the birds .
The of cial title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage and it is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Oceania Regional Of ce and ve Paci c Island countries : Samoa , Tonga , New Zealand , the Cook Islands and Fiji .
The main goal of the 6,000-nautical-mile ( 11,000km ) trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress .
According to the IUCN , as of 2013 , the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take .
And the effects of climate change were already beginning to impact seriously on Paci c Islanders .
I work hard and am good at my job but , when PizzaExpress thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hard-earned tips left on a card , I get upset .
PizzaExpress joins restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi in siphoning off 8 % of the tips paid by card but other chains deduct even more .
Cafe _ Rouge , Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10 % , as do Strada and Giraffe , which is owned by Tesco .
Almost 6,000 people have so far signed Unites online petition .
One waiter , who doesnt work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain , said that at least a third of his income is from tips .
The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change .
4C would likely be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous , Sherwood said .
For example , it would make life difficult , if not impossible , in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet , with sea levels rising by many metres as a result .
When water evaporates from the oceans , the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight ; or , it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds .
Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect , said Sherwood .
But what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models which predict less warming , not those that predict more .
Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam , the proportion has been 20 % .
Amin , 61 , from rural Bangladesh , has seen his livelihood gradually decline , due to his own and his wifes illnesses , the cost of his sons marriage , the death of his father and loss of goods such as shing nets .
Lovemore , 74 , from Zimbabwe , has become one of the poorest people in his village .
He recently lost his job as a car-park attendant due to ill health and had to take in his ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters .
The second is education , from early childhood to the start of work , to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty .
Even Nigeria , with its oil wealth , spends only $ 650 per capita , Shepherd said .
We Can Do It is not a female beer but a beer brewed by women that anyone can drink , she says .
One weekend they concocted the recipe and the next they brewed 1,600 litres .
This is not a beer that is aimed at women its our hoppiest brew , says Thomas Bingebo , the head brewer at Ocean .
FemAle has already been approached by other breweries asking if they can brew new beers with them .
From all across Rwanda , and even parts of neighbouring Burundi , people ock to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza ( Sweet Dreams ) .
Here , at the central African countrys rst ice- cream parlour , customers can buy scoops in sweet cream , passion fruit , strawberry and pineapple avours .
Ice cream is important , she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering .
True to Inzozi Nzizas motto , the shop can certainly make dreams come true .
Its something uniting people here , Kalisa Migendo , a 24-year-old agriculture student , says .
Inzozi Nziza was opened by the theatre director Odile Gakire Katese .
The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women , some survivors of the 1994 genocide , during which almost a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed .

Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills , he wrote .
What we did was to look at a set of current London taxi drivers and a set of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years , said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers , head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College London , who is an author of the study .
The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities , says Spiers .
Ultimately , McKinlay believes , its essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation .
La Premiere chose qu &apos;on regarde ( The First Thing We Look At ) by Grégoire Delacourt tells the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the book &apos;s lead male character thinks it is Johansson herself .
In the novel , the model &apos;s looks mean that men see her only as a sex object , while women are jealous of her .
She has a series of adventures as Johansson until she is eventually found out and , in the end , dies in a car crash .
Delacourt has become one of Frances best-loved authors ; his previous novel , My List of Desires , was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a lm .
I wrote a real love story and a homage to feminine beauty , especially interior beauty .
I thought she might send me owers as it was a declaration of love for her , but she didnt understand , Delacourt said .
All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of tness : stamina , handgrip strength and lower-body power .
The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular tness , muscle strength and ability to accelerate , all of which predict how good someone is at sport , in which such attributes are vital .
Those born in October were almost as t , scoring highest for strength and coming third for power , with December children close behind .
The gap in physical prowess between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide .
This is , potentially , a huge physical advantage , said Sandercock .
Such gaps could ultimately decide who became a top-level athlete because , as the paper says , selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individuals physical performance .
The ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage they are already known to have an academic advantage and , now , they also appear to be better equipped for sport , too .
Children that get a high-quality rst experience , which develops their physical literacy , are those that will have greater agility , balance and coordination , and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up , he said .
As soon as the children at one primary school in Stirling hear the words daily mile , they down their pencils and head out of the classroom to start running laps around the school eld .
For three-and-a-half years , all pupils at St Ninians Primary have walked or run a mile each day .
The thought of children across the country running every day because of something weve done is phenomenal .
In Stirling alone , 30 schools have already started or are to start the daily mile .
The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it ; otherwise , you couldnt sustain it .
At St Ninians , teachers take their pupils out of lessons on to a specially built circuit around the schools playing eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that days timetable .
The extent of the bene ts have yet to be determined but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for quantitative evidence of the physical , cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile .
Paralympian , Tanni Grey-Thompson , chair of ukactive , the UKs leading not-for-pro t health body for physical activity , said : All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day , whether in a lesson , on the walk to school or in the playground .
We know sitting still kills ; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life .
The Scottish government is also supportive .
In what Mason called the rst city-scale genetic pro le ever , his team found meningitis at Times Square , a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan .
All around the subway , bacteria associated with cheeses brie , cheddar , parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza turned up .
The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more localized to midtown Manhattan and the nancial district , and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the nancial district and Bay Ridge .
Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea , both benign and bad E.coli ( mostly benign ) , and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city .
He said he hoped the research would provide a baseline of research for health of cials and geneticists , and could help health of cials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens .
The yes campaign scored four big successes , winning 53 % of the vote in Scotlands largest city , Glasgow , 57 % in Dundee and 51 % in North Lanarkshire .
We have heard the voice of Scotland and , now , the millions of voices of England must be heard , he said .
Ed Miliband , the Labour leader , said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change .
We know our country needs to change in the way it is governed and we know our country needs to change in who it is governed for .
Theyve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years .
We will continue to ght with the facts because the facts are on our side , he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts .
Already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a naturalistic setting .

Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeares life , argues Paul Edmondson , the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust .
But Stratford is where he bought land and property , where he kept his library , where he lived and read and thought .
The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford , the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world , will be marked across Britain and the globe .
Macbeth will open in Singapore , Romeo and Juliet in Brussels .
In London , they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema , one screen to showcase each of Shakespeares plays , along the South Bank .
The National Theatre , the Royal Shakespeare Company and virtually every other theatre production company in the country will be marking the anniversary .
There will also be hundreds of lectures , recitals , international academic conferences , lms , concerts , operas and major exhibitions .
For a man famous in his own lifetime , there is little documentary evidence for Shakespeares life and times .
The actor Mark Rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving First Folios will be on display including those belonging to the British and Bodleian libraries , and a tattered copy recently discovered in France .
The general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare .
Hearing a click off a salmon is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does .
Hearing that subtle click is harder if theres a lot of noise around you .
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 individual ships as they passed through Haro Strait , in Washington State .
The two-year study captured the sounds made by 12 different types of vessel , including cruise ships , container ships and military vehicles , that passed through the strait about 20 times a day .
Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels , equivalent to 111 decibels through the air about the sound of a loud rock concert .
Whales are not usually located right next to ships and so would be subjected to noise of about 60 to 90 decibels around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner .
Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies .
Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise intensity by half .
Under the same conditions , a quarter of women pressed the shock button .
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities is one of a surprising few to tackle the question of why most of us nd it so hard to do nothing .
The only rules were they had to stay seated and not fall asleep .
On average , they did not enjoy the experience .
To the researchers surprise , 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks , as did six of 24 women .
Imagine the setup a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock , and they are told to just sit there and entertain themselves with their thoughts , she said .
Enter a department store and you will be watched .
Its that you need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and , in the past , that when those characteristics are present , this is what a person tends to do .
If it sounds familiar , its because the online world has been using techniques like these for years .
If I just showed you a shot of someones body you could probably tell me what gender they are .
We allow this to happen online so why not of ine ?
Among 6- to 7-year-olds , who have grown up with YouTube , Spotify music streaming and online television , the average DQ score was 98 , higher than for those aged between 45 and 49 , who scored an average of 96 .
The most remarkable change is in time spent talking on the phone .
For those aged 12 to 15 , phone calls account for just 3 % of time spent communicating through any device .
For all adults , this rises to 20 % and , for young adults , it is still three times as high at 9 % .
Away from their phones , 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media , too .
They spend 20 % of their time viewing short video clips , for example on YouTube , or news clips distributed via Facebook and other social sites .
The rest of their viewing is shared between DVDs , streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes .
From 2006 to 2008 , Duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in Spain .
He spent two months in prison before being bailed for 50,000 .
More than 25,000 kilos of dead sh were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds , chicks , eggs and nests were killed or destroyed .
It was Spain &apos;s worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost 90m .
There are riches here , riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants , said Vicente Fernandez Guerrero , secretary-general of Innovation , Industry and Energy for Andalucia .
People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times , after all .
The best technology in the world will be used here , Fernandez insisted .
For his part , Carlos Davila , who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana , was also alarmed at the proposal .
This is a very , very bad idea indeed , he told me .
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago .
After the disaster , Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it , he added .
It shows the power of Star Wars that , although they were disappointing , the prequels still managed to make a lot of money , said Rosser .
We may not yet be living in an age of ying cars , as predicted in the 1985 lm Back to the Future II , but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched .
Communication between riders and drivers , between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era , according to Allan Clelland , an expert on transportation technology .
According to the study , those born in the 1990s are making 4 % fewer car trips and travelling 18 % fewer miles per year , on average , than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives .
Companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling .
Automation Driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace .
To see what driverless cars might look like in action , go to the video at : vimeo.com / 37751380 .
The Mesolithic man , who lived in Spain around 7,000 years ago , had an unusual mix of blue eyes , black or brown hair and dark skin , according to analyses of his genetic make-up .
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006 .
This guy had to be darker than any modern European , but we dont know how dark , the scientist said .
You see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin .
You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour , Lalueza-Fox said .
The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related .
But , in 2013 , one of the mothers , who is 33 and unemployed , sued her ex-partner for maintenance for her daughter .
A DNA test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby .
Its four years later : you can understand she doesnt want to give up her baby .
But , whatever happens , someone wont be happy .
Karabo Ngidi , a lawyer with the centre , said Whats going to happen must be in the best interests of the children .
In 1995 , two mothers were awarded damages after their sons , born in 1989 , were accidentally switched at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born .
Tourist numbers are down 80 % this year , said Mayor Maria Kakali , in an of ce in the village where she grew up , home to around 200 people .
If we have to pay a tax of 23 % , Im sorry to say it but we will all die on the island , says Kakali .
It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors , compared with tens of thousands on an island such as Rhodes .
The truth is the government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean , she said , so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament , to tell them : There is still life in these islands .
The age of the big British summer music festival , including Glastonbury , is drawing to a close , according to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith .
That is a big , big problem in our industry .
And , we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts the likes of the Rolling Stones , Muse , even the Arctic Monkeys that can headline .
There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014 , he said , and there is no way they can all continue .
He didnt want to risk leaving the US it was him , not Elvis , said Goldsmith .
Freddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer , the best live performer weve ever had .
Were not producing a new generation of this kind of act .
Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was ten years ago .
So , with no big acts to headline , there are no big shows .
What is it like to look at the very last of something ?
If he does not mate successfully soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya , there will be no more of their kind , male or female , born anywhere .
Apart from these three animals , there are only two other northern white rhinos in the world , both in zoos , both female .
His eye is a sad black dot in his massive wrinkled face as he wanders the reserve with his guards .
It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone and leathery esh , a head that expresses pure strength .
Human beings we always kill the things we love .
But the same people who painted such sensitive portraits of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them off .
The northern white rhino is the rarest species of African rhino .
There are far greater numbers of southern white rhinos and black rhinos .
From 2007 , when just 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa , the killings have grown horri cally .
In 2014 , 1,215 rhinos were slaughtered for their horns in South Africa .
In 2006 , the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe sh in their natural environment .
Although it allows you to stay underwater for longer , you have to plan your whole day around it .
You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you you cant be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in .
It was during a nal-year project for his product design degree at the University of Limerick that Redmond produced the Express Dive .
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be re lled .
Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel .
The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater , he says .
A lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day , every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life , including people that I dont really have a relationship with , she said .
One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world , she said .
I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else .
He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed .
And with no friends accounts to follow online , he has to pick up the phone and call them , something hes come to de nitely enjoy .
Lauren Raskauskas , 22 , Naples , Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a pretty private person .
She recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago after realizing she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing .
He claims that he hasnt seen any effect at this point .
Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook , they make sure to send him a text message , too , he said .
His billing , The Beale Street Blues Boy , was shortened to Blues Boy King and thence to BB .
But he would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt .
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill : I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style , like Elmore James and Booker White .
About a year and a half ago , he said in 1969 , all of a sudden , kids started coming up to me saying , Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world .
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette rms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers .
Numbers who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down , West said .
Weve only been tracking vaping for just over a year , so its a short time period , but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes .
Our customers are still very happy with the product , and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes .
They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective .
There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors , he said .
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in , Baghdad is the worst and London , Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35 , according to international research into quality of life .
German-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study , with Vienna joined by Zurich , Munich , Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven .
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad , said Hartlauer .
We also have terri c public transport , with the underground working 24 hours at weekends , and it only costs 1 per trip .
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped de ne Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe .
Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun .
We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process ( including how much they take home from tips and whether its fair ) and what would improve it for them .
Rodri , 37 , London : Around 50 % of a waiters income is tips Average tips : 60 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... the US Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015 .
However , you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains .
I can average around 60 in tips per shift but , on a good night , this goes up to over 100 and , on a poor night , its around 40 .
Elle , 22 , Edinburgh : We never know whether its fair Average tips : 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France I work three jobs , all on part-time zero-hours contracts , in catering and hospitality .
In restaurants , because a lot of customers add tips through card payments , the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped so we dont know whether were getting our fair share or not .
Its really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers .
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips .
I make around 20 a shift but would only be given 10-15 of that money .
I really rely on tips because I am only paid 7 an hour .
Tom , Manchester : A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips : 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy Where I used to work , oor staff kept 80 % of cash tips and 40 % of card tips .
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift ; maybe around 40 , 20 from card tips .
They have got tipping right in Italy , where people dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so , if they get a meal for 19 , they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change .
A more open and connected world is a better world .
You wont be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend : you already know theyre dating someone else from the romantic sel es .
It doesnt necessarily mean we see them the same way .
Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group .
An overwhelming majority of 91 % post a photo of themselves , 71 % post the city or town where they live , up from 61 % , more than half give email addresses and a fth give their phone number .
The data and analytics available to you are extraordinary .
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Though the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution , organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook .
5 Facebook makes news , breaks news and decides what is news Roughly 71 % of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63 % of users overall , according to the Pew Research Center .
And 39 % are connected to people they have never met in person .
We may as well get used to it , said David Kirkpatrick , author of The Facebook Effect .
If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25 % , there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished , according to the UN .
Each year , 1.3bn tonnes of food , about a third of all that is produced , is wasted , including about 45 % of all fruit and vegetables , 35 % of sh and seafood , 30 % of cereals , 20 % of dairy products and 20 % of meat .
In the developing world , food waste is virtually non-existent , says Robert van Otterdijk , coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Save Food programme .
Food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food .
The foods most commonly found in British bins are bread , vegetables , fruit and milk .
By percentage , the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads , of which consumers throw away 38 % ( 64,000 tonnes ) of all they buy .
Cockrell , a former Wall Street worker turned therapist , spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street , as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people .
Many of the extremely wealthy the 1 % of the 1 % feel that their problems are really not problems .
There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich .
And , then , there is the isolation being in the 1 % , it turns out , can be lonely .
The media , she said , is partly to blame for making the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed .
Since the 2008 nancial crisis , the income gap has expanded and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy , Cockrell said .
Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means , I think that is dif cult , said Cockrell .
Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret .
There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment , said Traeger-Muney .
If you are part of the 1 % , you still have problems and they are legitimate to you .
Money is not the only thing that de nes you , he said .
Is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream ?
Apple is good at mainstreaming products but its not that good .
Apple , and the record industry , cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand , one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker .
A century ago , Venice one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world used to ood around ten times a year .
I manage one minute and 12 seconds .
At a pool in Bristol , she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater .
I asked how she did it : very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive , then a big , deep breath before diving in .
At least , it doesnt if youre breath-holding on land .
When you breathe in , youre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm , pulling it at so that the volume of your chest increases and air is drawn into your lungs .
Steve Deace , a prominent Iowa conservative , said that Trumps antics are both a good and a bad thing .
As the pollster notes : Trump says what theyre thinking and , the more outrageous he is , the more they agree with him .
Sometimes life just isnt fair .
In fact , he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since .
The website ATMInventor.com concludes : Who invented the idea of an ATM ?
In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century , it states : In the 1960s , James Goodfellow ( 1937- ) invented the cash-dispensing automatic teller machine ( ATM ) or cashpoint .
So after all these years , Goodfellow nally nds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird ( the television ) , Alan Turing ( the Turing machine ) , Sir Frank Whittle ( the jet engine ) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee ( the World Wide Web ) .
British people think the top 1 % wealthiest households own 59 % of their countrys wealth , when they actually only own 23 % .
Americans think that 33 % of their population are immigrants , when in fact it is only 14 % .
In Britain , people think that an extraordinary 43 % of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents , rather than the actual 14 % .
The worst case is Saudi Arabia , where people think only 28 % are , when 71 % are .
Britons think it is 44 % , when it is actually nearly half as much again 62 % are either overweight or obese .
And , in many ways , it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study .
Thats 65 litres of clean , drinkable water that were infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day sometimes more than once .
The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore , as California enters another summer of drought .
Skip a few showers , put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria ourish a little , would you ?
The conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds .
For the older teenagers , it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later .
Kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms .
Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups , he says : Between 14 and 24 , its more than two hours .
For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35 , its about an hour and a half .
Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive consequences .
The positive side of this is peoples performance , mood and health will improve .
Its very uplifting in a way because its a solution that will make people less ill , and happier and better at what they do .
A later start to the day for many , says Kelley , is something that would bene t everyone , particularly families .
And , yes , he says he nds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger .
Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked , in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is .
One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks .
If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood , it can deliver from that base .
You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance .
The Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours , Singh said .
Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and , thus , standards are much higher .
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the East Hampton Food Pantry , she says , which is just one of several food pantries in the town .
Vicki Littman , chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry , which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015 , says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing .
Housing is , by far , the biggest cost in the Hamptons .
Theres certainly a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer , says Cantwell , the son of a sherman father and a house-cleaner mother .
But , the rest of us live here year round .
There are famous and very wealthy people but then you have hard-working and poor people struggling to get by .
Youve got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and shing community of people who lived off the land and the water a real working-class community .
I want to work but theres no work to be done .
Some danced , some posed for photos , some drank , but mostly they just walked and talked football , waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby FanFest big screen .
The trip has not been problem free .
His son , Andrew , had his sunglasses stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach .
And , they have been surprised that many bars are not set up with big screens for the games .
But , like many fans , they said they loved the atmosphere , if not the logistics , of this tournament which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch .
Elsewhere , there has been a glut of goals : 28 in the rst eight games almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010 .
The Globo newspaper listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities .
The worst transport problems were in Natal , where bus drivers have been on strike since 12 June .
But , protests have diminished since the opening day , when small demonstrations took place in several cities , prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray .
Since then , the only security threat has been petty theft and overexcited fans .
But , these days , the golden arches of McDonalds are looking a little tarnished .
Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his rst restaurant in Des Plaines , Illinois , consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries .
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13 % since 2011 , according to food analysts Technomic , while the number of 22-to-37-year- olds visiting has not grown .
To add to the companys problems , McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners , who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys , Smashburger or Fuddruckers .
Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers ?
Ever since it introduced $ 2 items on its dollar menu , it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals , while many consumers complain that service is slower .
Prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US .
McDonalds has a bigger menu than some , with more complicated items its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make .
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger , he said , raising questions about how it could be scaled up .
Faehrmann said the protests had shown Australians wanted sharks protected : Whats amazing is so many people in Australia love sharks .
Anthony Joyce , a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth , said : The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things .
Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans , as no previous cull has solely used drumlines .
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastest-growing population in Australia , rather than a rising number of sharks .
The activity in Western Australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks .
Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it .
All youre going to achieve , I think , is to worry people unnecessarily .

Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it emerged that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts .
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals , including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace , which uses them for its 350 summer workers .
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff 80 % of its workforce on the terms .
Dave Prentis , of the trade union Unison , said : The vast majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice .
The charity National Trust , which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts , said it offered the same pay and bene ts to those workers , pro rata , as full-time staff , but needed some workers to be on a more exible arrangement .
Our properties have told us its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this .
While some employees welcome the exibility of such contracts , for many , zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come , he said .
The institutes gures also suggest that 17 % of employers in the private sector made use of zero- hours contracts , considerably lower than the 34 % of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24 % in the public sector .
Industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels , catering and leisure ( 48 % ) , education ( 35 % ) and healthcare ( 27 % ) .
