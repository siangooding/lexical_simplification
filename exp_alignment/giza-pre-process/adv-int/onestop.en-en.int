Brazil and Peru have made objections to a bid made by the huge US e-commerce company for a prime new piece of cyberspace: .amazon.
Until now, the differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easy to see in every internet address by the use of .com, .gov and 20 other categories.
But these categories  or generic top-level domains (gTLDs) as they are technically known  are about to see the biggest expansion since the start of the worldwide web.
Amazon has applied for many new domains, including .shop, .song, .book and .kindle.
Allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to strengthen their brand or to profit from the meaning of these names is not, in our view, in the public interest, the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said.
Brazil said its views were supported by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela).
Argentina is unhappy that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament.
Argentina rejects the .patagonia request for a new generic top-level domain.
Patagonia is an important region for the countrys economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources.
The first approved domain names will probably be in use before the end of 2013.   
But the Dutch capitals plans to send nuisance neighbours to scum villages made from shipping containers may damage its reputation for tolerance.
The Mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, says his controversial new 810,000 policy to deal with antisocial behaviour is to protect victims of abuse and homophobia.
The camps, where antisocial families will be rehoused for three to six months, have been called scum villages because the policy is similar to proposals from Geert Wilders, the far-right politician, who last year said that repeat offenders should be sent to a village for scum.
Bartho Boer, a spokesman for the Mayor, says that the plans are not illiberal.
We want everyone to be who he and she is  whether they are gay and lesbian or resist violence and are then victims of harassment.
According to Boer, the villages are not for a problem neighbour who has the stereo too loud on Saturday night but people who are extremely violent and intimidating and in a clear situation where a victim is being harassed again and again.
People found guilty of causing extreme havoc will be evicted and put in basic temporary homes, including converted shipping containers in industrial areas of the city.
Dutch newspaper the Parool has written that in the 19th century troublemakers were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which rapidly became slums.
But Boer insists that the government has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to house antisocial families together.
The city government expects to move around ten families a year into this programme, which starts in 2013.
The temporary accommodation will be heavily policed, but antisocial families will also have access to doctors, social workers and parole officers.
Brazils latest funk sensation, Anitta, has won millions of fans by making the favela sound popular, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour.
Anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industrys fastest rising star has had to give up her blackness to be a success in the predominantly white middle-class market.
The controversy began with the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of Anittas skin tone since she signed a deal with Warner.
Jarid Arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the discrimination in media and marketing that she felt Anittas image change represented.
She now has an album and a huge hit single, Show das Poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views.
Brazil  one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery  has the largest population of African descent outside Africa, but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour.
Most business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers.
If you walk through Ipanema, Gvea or other rich districts, you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white children than a white nanny pushing a black child.
Sylvio Ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the Federal University of Pernambuco, believes Anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it more acceptable to everyone.
Unlike more accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera on a car roof, for Googles Iqaluit project mappers walked the towns snowpacked roads and crossed little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the short summer months.
The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now is while searching for the Northwest Passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, an officer and son of the US President, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase.
One difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office, not delivered to their address.
Arif Sayani, the towns Director of Planning, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area.
It may also speed up planning decisions in Iqaluit.
The controversial auction of a Banksy mural that disappeared from the wall of a north London shop was dramatically stopped just moments before it was going to be sold.
Claire Kober, Leader of Haringey Council, wrote to Arts Council England and the Mayor of Miami, Toms Regalado, to ask them to stop the sale, but it appears the decision to remove the item from sale came from the gallery owners.
Although there are no legal issues whatsoever regarding the sale of lots six and seven by Banksy, FAAM convinced its sellers to remove these lots from the auction.
Critics have accused the auction house of buying and selling stolen property but Thut said that the seller, who he described as a well known collector, was the rightful owner and that the sale was legal.
The second Banksy to be auctioned, a 2007 artwork called Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall and is estimated to be worth up to $800,000, was removed from the auction houses online catalogue, but Slave Labour was still listed for sale right up to the 3pm start time.
The huge fortunes made by the worlds richest 100 billionaires are increasing inequality and hindering the worlds ability to tackle poverty, according to Oxfam.
Oxfam said the worlds poorest could be taken out of poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012.
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are among a group of 40 US billionaires who have said they will give much of their wealth to aid projects, but there is little detail about the level of their annual donations.
In the report, The Cost of Inequality: How Wealth and Income Extremes Hurt Us All, published just before the World Economic Forum in Davos, the charity asks world leaders to commit to reducing inequality to at least 1990 levels.
Barbara Stocking, Oxfams Chief Executive, said studies show that countries suffer low levels of investment and growth as workers are forced to survive on a smaller share of total incomes.
She said: We can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will benefit the many  too often the reverse is true.
In China, the top 10% now earn nearly 60% of the income.
Chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in South Africa, which is now the most unequal country on Earth.
Stocking said: We need to reverse decades of increasing inequality.
As a first step, world leaders should formally agree to reduce inequality to the levels seen in 1990.
She said closing tax havens, which hold as much as $31 trillion, or as much as a third of all global wealth, could collect $189bn in additional taxes.     
Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from Facebooks and Apples instant messaging applications to independent apps such as WhatsApp and Kik (which is also Canadian).
They are free to download and use, and they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, stickers and even videos between most types of phones.
In an attempt to keep its customers, BBM has been released on Android and Apple phones.
BBM says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but WhatsApp has 300 million.
Other services show BBMs limitations: unlike Skype and Viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls; unlike Path, it does not do location sharing; there is no video sharing, as on iMessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), adored by kids all over the world, are also absent.
Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry phones are not on the Apple and Android versions.
Photos uploaded to Instagram get instant comments and Snapchats pictures, which selfdelete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities.
But as recently as 2011, BBM was so powerful it helped to start a revolution in Egypt; and at the time of the London riots, it was a more immediate source of news than the television screen.
He manages a youth club in Stockwell, south London, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and poverty in Britain.
Nearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but two-thirds use more than one.
Its a much more complex, multifaceted environment, says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist.
All of these apps use your smartphone  they plug into your phone book and your photo library.
He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, uses an iPhone to play games, and makes phone calls on an Android phone.
When I saw my mum on Facebook, I deleted my account.
Arrests and prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief.
Bolivia had argued that the convention was in 2 opposition to its new constitution, adopted in 2009, which says it must protect native and ancestral coca as part of its cultural heritage and maintains that coca in its natural state  is not a narcotic.
The leaves are said to provide energy and have medicinal qualities.
The Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking, said Danny Kushlick, of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which supports drug liberalization.
However, the UNs International Narcotics Control 4 Board (INCB), which checks implementation of global drug treaties, says that Bolivia is threatening international drug controls.
The right of indigenous people in South Americas 6 Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention.
But Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban.
Bolivias return could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request.
Nancie Prudhomme, of the International Centre 10 on Human Rights and Drug Policy, criticized the co-ordinated opposition to Bolivias demands.
The growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed in Bolivia.
There should be greater flexibility, less masculine cultures, more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards.
Maria Miller, the Minister for Women and Equalities, said: The CMI figures are another example from the world of work showing that women still lose out to their male counterparts.
However, the CMIs data did provide some evidence to support Millers statement that the overall pay gap is narrowing: the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses appeared to shrink from 2012.
A sub-set of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been followed over a number of years, showed that male managers earnings are rising faster than womens for the first time in five years.
Brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than 100,000 people took to the streets to express their frustration at aggressive policing, poor public services and high costs for the World Cup.
The unrest increased during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside a government office, smashed the buildings windows and painted graffiti on the walls that said Revolution, Down with Paes, down with Cabral [the mayor and state governor] and Hate police.
There must be something wrong with this country, said Nadia al Husin.
In Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to get into a football stadium, which was hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti.
In Porto Alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in Curitiba, protesters tried to force their way into the office of the state governor.
You could see another global link in the demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks, associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests.
Brazils demonstrations are being referred to as the vinegar revolution (after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to fight the effects of tear gas), as well as the 20-cent revolution (due to the bus price rise) and the Passe Livre (after the demand for free public transport).
Before Saturdays opening match in Brasilia, crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police.
Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children, as they heard the sound of shots  perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas.
Another protest march, near Rios Maracana Stadium, also had a heavy police response.
She faces a serious political challenge, both now and in 2014, when Brazil will not only host the World Cup but also have a presidential election.     
Menthol and other flavours will be banned from 2022, and MEPs also decided that most electronic cigarettes, which are increasingly popular as alternatives to tobacco products, do not need to be regulated in the same way as medicines.
Health officials and the e-cigarette industry in Britain want to clarify what this means  for instance, whether e-cigarette companies will have the same bans on sponsorship and promotion at sports events as tobacco firms.
But, in a statement, the DH said: We are very pleased to see tougher action on tobacco, with European controls banning flavoured cigarettes and the introduction of stricter rules on front-of-pack health warnings.
However, we are disappointed with the decision not to regulate nicotine-containing products (NCPs), including e-cigarettes, as medicines.
The UK e-cigarette industry, which welcomed the parliaments vote, said it was already in talks with the Advertising Standards Authority but added that it would not be sensible, reasonable or useful to ban all advertising.
They want to put the e-cigarettes, used by an estimated 1.3 million people in Britain, on the same legal basis as gums, patches and mouth sprays, which help smokers to quit, but the industry says that licensing is expensive and this would force alternatives to tobacco off the shelves.
The MEPs voted to put health warnings on 65% of each cigarette pack.
The UK government has delayed a decision on whether to follow Australia by introducing standardized packaging until there is evidence that this will reduce tobacco use.
We need to stop tobacco companies targeting young people with gimmicky products and we need to make sure that cigarette packs have effective warnings.
Martin Callanan, the Conservative MEP for North East England, said: Forcing e-cigarettes off the shelves would have been totally crazy.
These are products that have helped many people stop smoking more harmful cigarettes and yet some MEPs wanted to make them harder to manufacture than ordinary tobacco.
Coal will probably rival oil as the worlds biggest source of energy in the next five years, with possible disastrous consequences for the climate, says the worlds leading authority on energy economics.
New research from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world  even in countries and regions with carbon-cutting targets  except in the US, where shale gas is now more popular than coal.
Maria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said that coal consumption continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made, coal will catch oil within a decade.
Coal is available in large amounts and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted.
China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia the biggest exporter.
According to the IEAs Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today.
When these are not equipped with special scrubbing equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions  the leading cause of acid rain  and mercury and soot-particle pollution.
Van der Hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power, only competition from lower-priced gas could reduce demand for coal.
This has happened in the US, due to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years.
If something isnt done, the world faces an increased risk of climate change as a result of this fast-increasing consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel.     
Illegal downloading is a kind of moral squalor and theft, as much as putting your hand in someones pocket and stealing their wallet is theft, says author Philip Pullman.
He criticizes internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them.
His article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street to discuss the issue of web piracy.
Pullman, writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level that gives delight to their audiences and, as soon as they achieve that, the possibility of earning a living from it is taken away from them.
Casserly argues that there is a lot wrong with copyright, which was created in an analogue age.
She writes: Copyright closes the door on the many ways that people can share, build upon and remix each others work, possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were made.
She says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and earn money from their work, quoting the science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, who said: My problem is not piracy, its obscurity.
The debate is a lively one and the scale of illegal downloading is enormous.
Ofcom says 18% of internet users aged over 12 admit that they have recently pirated content, and 9% say they fear getting caught.
Pullman writes in his article: The ease and speed with which music can be acquired in the form of MP3 downloads is still astonishing to those of us who have been building up our iTunes list for some time.
Following the Downing Street meeting, Cameron appointed the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his adviser on the subject.
We hope his influence and the prime ministers support for copyright will influence the approach of the UKs intellectual property office.   
So he tried crowdfunding on a US website, Indiegogo, which has recently opened in the UK.
His campaign to get donations from the public was so popular that within 40 days he had raised 400,000.
The LED light is powered by a dynamo driven by a 10kg bag of rocks.
The weight is attached to the light, lifted to a height of about 2m, and while it slowly falls to the ground it will generate enough power for half an hour of light.
Hunt is preparing for production in China and will test the market again by sending 1,000 of the lights to Africa before the full mass production of millions of units.
He is one of a new wave of entrepreneurs who are turning to the fast-growing crowdfunding industry for money.
Another new site is InvestingZone, which matches wealthy people with start-up entrepreneurs.
Indiegogo does not offer shares but allows users to offer perks for different levels of investment  people who helped to fund Hunts light felt good about helping the less rich, but also got their own light.
It is the first time that getting money has been fast, efficient and meritocratic, because it is not about How do I get access to the decision makers in that bank?
This is all about proving your worth to your customers and fans, getting them to agree your idea will work and fund it.
Even ideas that dont get funding are worth testing, because you will have saved yourself a lot of time finding out it wasnt a good idea and getting smarter faster, she says.
Five years on and the site is raising about $2m a week for new businesses in start-up and growth stages.
There is no shortage of competitors, be it Kickstarter, Seedrs or Funding Circle, but Indiegogo is the only crowdfunder where anyone can launch a campaign.
The site charges a 4% fee for successful campaigns.
For those that fail to raise their target amount, users can either refund all money to their contributors at no charge or keep all money raised but pay a 9% fee.
A British woman raised 100,000 to open a cat caf in London through the site.
Called Lady Dinahs Cat Emporium, it is not open yet but is advertised as somewhere people can come in from the cold to a comfortable chair, a hot cup of tea, a book and a cat.
Weve seen campaigns that go to venture capitalists get rejected because the venture capitalists say great idea but no idea if the market actually wants it; it could be something that no one cares about, said Ringelmann.
The entrepreneurs do an Indiegogo campaign and this can be enough market proof for venture capitalists to say there is a market for this.
It allows you to test your market, test your pricing, test your features, discover new ways of getting money, get vital feedback, says Ringelmann.
With her Wall Street background and the experience of helping 100,000 businesses and services raise money, Ringelmann has useful advice for budding entrepreneurs.
I got frustrated with everyone saying they were really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but no mention of children, Limal said.
But we dont make them say how many children theyd like.
We had 50 sign-ups an hour when we started in June and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together.
More men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with comments such as Its so lovely to be able to say this out loud and I finally dare to be honest about what I want.
The site has come at the right time for the country of five million people.
He says that this isnt just about baby farming: I want this to be about children and love.
There are plans to launch the site in France and the UK later in 2013, but for now it is the Danes who are benefitting from it.
He is now in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal  he flew down from Everest base camp that morning.
Cool is talking about a startling sequence of climbs completed the previous weekend.
For the first time since the late 1990s, there were fixed ropes on all three mountains, he says.
Sixty years after Everest was first climbed, many of the media reports are looking back to Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay and their age of innocence from the modern era of commercialism and environmental damage.
I hate to think, he says, but mentions the Swiss climber, Ueli Steck, who fled the mountain in April after an argument with a crowd of Sherpas at Camp 2.
Hes technically brilliant but he had also taken his physical condition to the highest possible level.
Moro flew back to Everest on Tuesday at the controls of a high-powered helicopter to rescue a climber at an altitude of 7,800 metres.
It was the highest rescue ever performed on Everest and highlights the huge rise in helicopter flights in recent years.
By 2073, the infrastructure on the mountain might include a helipad on the South Col that would bring tourists.
It is not certain that the Everest region can continue to cope with a booming tourism sector, according to mountain geographer and environmentalist, Alton Byers.
A new road for 4x4s is being built to Lukla to guarantee the flow of tourists and their money, but Byers is worried that the rapid spread of the road network in Nepal is being done too cheaply, with disastrous consequences in terms of soil erosion and landslides.
Its the perfect laboratory for figuring out how to solve some of these problems, like the impacts of climate change and tourism. 
Fit in four minutes sounds like a headline from a health magazine or an impossible promise on late-night satellite TV.
One group of moderately trained students did an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week.
The other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike, followed by four minutes of Tabata training, four times a week  plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of Tabata.
After six weeks of testing, the group following Tabatas plan  exercising for just 88 minutes a week  had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and their VO2 max, something that shows your cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power, by 15%.
You cant sit on a cross trainer, chewing gum and reading the latest issue of HELLO!
In the original plan the aim was to get to eight, but some only managed six or seven.
I decided to do this because I often go on YouTube and, while I am pleased that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong because they dont realize how hard they need to work, says Tabata.
Runners, for instance, need a high level of running economy, which comes from learning the skills and running for many miles, says Scrivener, But they could reduce the number of long runs and the overall mileage by introducing Tabata training.
In the UK, 1.4m fewer users visited in March, a fall of 4.5%.
Path, the mobile phone-based social network founded by former Facebook employee Dave Morin, which only allows its users to have 150 friends, is gaining 1m users a week.
India has seen a 4% rise to 64m  still only a fraction of the countrys population, so there is room for more growth.
Analysts at Jefferies bank saw global numbers of visitors to Facebook peak at 1.05bn a month in January, before falling by 20m in February.
The network has now lost nearly 2m visitors in the UK since December, according to research firm Nielsen, with its 27m total the same as a year ago.
Although smartphone minutes have doubled in a year, to 69 a month, that growth may not compensate for dwindling desktop usage.
One initiative, Facebook Home, is software that can be downloaded onto Android phones to feed news and photos from friends  and advertising  directly to the owners locked home screen.   
Susumu Tonagawa, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and his team wanted to study how these false memories might form in the human brain, so they encoded memories in the brains of mice by manipulating individual neurons.
These records are encoded in physical and chemical changes in brain cells and the connections between them.
According to Tonagawa, both false and genuine memories seem to use the same brain mechanisms.
The next day, the same mice were put in a second box and given a small electric shock, to encode a fear response.
At the same time, the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to activate their memories of the first box.
That way, the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first box.
The mice froze, showing a typical fear response, even though they had never been shocked in that box.
A similar process may happen when powerful false memories are created in humans.
So, just like our mouse, it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good events.
We hope our future findings along this line will show legal experts how unreliable memory can be.
Chris French, of the University of London, is a leading researcher in false memories in people.
He said that the latest results were an important first step in understanding them.
Memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not work like a video camera, recording all the details of anything we experience.
He warned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have caused controversy within psychology and psychiatry  for example, false memories of childhood sexual abuse, abduction by aliens, or past lives.
Such rich false memories will clearly involve many brain systems and we are still a long way from understanding the processes involved in their formation at the neuronal level, he said.
Mark Stokes, a neuroscientist at Oxford University, said the experiments were a great achievement but that it was important to put them into perspective.
Now that we can change the contents of memories in the brain, we can begin asking questions that were once the realm of philosophy, said Steve Ramirez, a colleague of Tonagawas at MIT.
These are the seemingly sci-fi questions that can now be experimentally tackled in the lab.
In whatever way we implant false memories, we need to be very aware of the ethical issues raised by such procedures  the potential for abuse of such techniques cannot be overstated.   
The Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, will retire at the end of the season after 27 years as the most successful manager in British football.
Talking about his decision, Ferguson said: The decision to retire is one that I have thought a great deal about.
It was important to me to leave an organization in the strongest possible condition and I believe I have done so.
Our training facilities are amongst the best in world sport and our home, Old Trafford, is regarded as one of the leading venues in the world.
I am delighted to take on the roles of both director and ambassador for the club.
In my early years, the support of the board of directors gave me the confidence and time to build a football club, not just a football team.
Over the past ten years, the Glazer family have made it possible for me to manage Manchester United to the best of my ability and I have been extremely fortunate to have worked with a talented and trustworthy chief executive, David Gill.
It is understood that he gathered the players in the first-team changing room shortly after they arrived for training.
I will never forget the wonderful memories he has given us, like that magical night in Moscow.
We knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the team and club structures are in first-class condition.
Alexs vision, energy and ability have built teams that are among the best and most loyal in world sport.
It has been the greatest experience of my working life being with Alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend.
First-team coach Ren Meulensteen revealed how Ferguson broke the news to his backroom staff.
He called us into his office and told us his decision.
Not many exercise classes have a tea break halfway through.
Despite an extremely painful trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement, she looks like she could go on for hours.
But, on the afternoon I visit Allens class in Saltburn-by-the-Sea near Middlesbrough, slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break.
Allen, a former volunteer with the charity Red Cross, has been leading classes in the north-east town for 45 years.
She wasnt particularly sporty at school, but she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired.
At one time, Allens class had more than 18 regulars, each paying 1 a time.
Allen thinks her good health is largely a result of keeping busy, especially since her husband died in 1997.
I just cant stop, she says, when she phones me a few days after the interview to read out a poem she has written about the joys of exercise.
She happily remembers a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years ago, who said she couldnt possibly be more than 78: I said, Thank you, doctor.
There will not be enough water to produce food for the expected nine-billion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations, the report by Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) said.
There will be just enough water if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.
Warnings that water scarcity could limit food production come at the same time as Oxfam and the UN prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years.
Animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet.
Other options to feed people include stopping waste and increasing trade between countries that have a food surplus and countries that dont have enough food.
Nine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished although per-capita food production continues to increase, they said.
The report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm, Sweden, where 2,500 politicians, UN groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to discuss global water supply problems.
Competition for water between food production and other uses will increase pressure on essential resources, the scientists said.
He is now 36 and his life can be divided into two phases.
Eventually he was arrested for serious drug crimes and was sent to prison for 12 years.
They work with the police, the probation service and other, voluntary organizations to help people who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs of London.
For Smart, the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he was in prison.
I was talking to the prisoners and they knew what changes they needed in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the index offence.
One guy had a 300-a-week cocaine habit, which he paid for through burglary.
Then he developed an idea to run his own scheme when he was out of prison  using the experience of ex-offenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life.
But in general he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that, once the leader of a gang is arrested, the problem is solved.
They often do the street dealing or even the stabbing, he says.
I try to help a young person who has been earning 300 a week through illegal methods.
But with unemployment high and cuts to benefits, it makes things more difficult.
But if the UNESCO World Heritage Site that crosses the equator is exploited for oil, as the Congolese government and exploration firm SOCO International are hoping, it could lead to devastating pollution and permanent conflict in the region, says the WWF.
SOCO International is the only company that wants to explore inside the boundaries of the Virunga park.
SOCO insist that their operations in Congo would be kept to an area in the park known as Block V, and would not affect the gorillas.
However, Raymond Lumbuenamo, country director for WWF Democratic Republic of the Congo, based in Kinshassa, said that security in and around the park would get worse if SOCO went ahead with its exploration plans.
Virungas rich natural resources are for the benefit of the Congolese people, not for foreign oil prospectors.
The park, Africas oldest and most diverse, is home to over 3,000 different kinds of animals, but is now heavily populated with desperately poor people, many of whom went there after the Rwanda massacre in 1994.
In all, the park could support around 45,000 permanent jobs.
In addition, people around the world could know that the park is well managed and is safe for future generations, says the report.
Nobody knows which came first: the economic crisis in Greece or shisha, the drug now known as the cocaine of the poor.
It is the worst kind of drug.
It burns your insides, it makes you aggressive and makes you go totally mad, said Maria, a former heroin addict.
For Charalampos Poulopoulos, the head of Kethea, Greeces anti-drug centre, shisha symbolizes the crisis that has led to record levels of destitution and unemployment.
It is, he said, an austerity drug  it is the response of dealers who have become more and more clever at producing synthetic drugs designed for those who can no longer afford more expensive highs from such drugs as heroin and cocaine.
The crisis has given dealers the possibility to promote a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for the poor, said Poulopoulos at a centre for addicts in Exarcheia, in Athens.
Across Greece, six years of recession have been brutal and cruel.
Depression, together with drug and alcohol abuse, has risen dramatically.
Prostitution  the easiest way of paying for drugs  has similarly skyrocketed.
Many women agree to have unprotected sex because that way theyll make more money, said Eleni Marini, a psychologist with Kethea.
Shisha has been linked to a very intense sexual drive but it attacks your ability to think clearly and were seeing a lot more pregnancies among drug addicts who engage in prostitution.
Since the financial crisis began in 2009, Kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff.
The cuts come despite studies that show that, for every euro they spend on anti-drug programmes such as Kethea, the Greek state saves about 6 in costs to the criminal justice and healthcare systems.
During a momentous day at Liverpool Cathedral for the families of the 96 people who died so needlessly at Sheffield Wednesdays Hillsborough football ground, you could hear one phrase again and again: the truth.
The panel found that the South Yorkshire Police, led by the Chief Constable, Peter Wright, told their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster.
The victims blood was tested for alcohol levels.
It was done to remove criticism of the police, the report said.
But it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police, led by an inexperienced Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, that was the main cause of the disaster.
Noma has been named the worlds best restaurant by Restaurant magazine for three years.
Bee larvae make a sweet mayonnaise used instead of eggs and scientists are constantly finding new ways to use insects.
Many experts believe there is a clear environmental benefit to humans eating insects.
Think of that next time you put it into your tea.
He said that the basic idea behind Nordic Food Lab was: Nothing is not edible.
Insects are critical to life on Earth and, with more than a million species, are the most diverse group of creatures on the planet, but they are misunderstood, hated and often killed by humans just because they are there.
The increase will put more pressure on agricultural land, water, forests, fisheries and resources, as well as nutrients and energy supplies.
Edible insects produce fewer gases, contain high-quality protein, vitamins and amino acids, and need only a quarter of the food that sheep need, and half that of pigs and chickens, to produce the same amount of protein.
They produce fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cows and can be grown on organic waste.
Zimbabwe has a thriving caterpillar industry and Laos was given nearly $500,000 by the FAO to develop an insect-harvesting project.
A study by FoodServiceWarehouse.com suggested that giving up pork and beef and eating crickets and locusts instead could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95%.
But perhaps the fairest thing about eating worms and insects comes when we are dead  then they get a chance to eat us. 
Consumers who believed they had eaten expensive kuruma shrimps were told they had in fact eaten the much cheaper black tiger version.
The scandal started when a diner complained in a blogpost that a scallop dish he had ordered at the Prince Hotel in Tokyo contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish.
Its report scared Hankyu-Hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients.
The Hotel Okura chain  whose guests have included Barack Obama  said they had also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic.
The list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow: orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed; Mont Blanc desserts topped with Korean chestnuts instead of the promised French ones; shop-bought chocolate cream that the menu said was home-made; imported beef sold as expensive wagyu.
Even the governments top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, commented on the scandal.
This inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers, he told reporters.
One local newspaper had the headline, Japans proud food culture in tears, while the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun said it was shocked by the industrys lack of morals.
Its a simplified version of Google Glass.
Youll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on Facebook or send them as an email, or see and speak to a video image of a friend.
Of course, not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset, I tell him.
In his shared office space in San Francisco  a cool, converted warehouse  he quotes Sun Tzus The Art of War and says that even tiny armies can sometimes beat powerful forces.
The top manufacturers all want to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just struggle to sell it.
He certainly has the confidence of Jobs, but, with a thick Japanese accent, he sometimes struggles to make himself understood, a fact that may have contributed to his idea for Telepathy One.
When he went to London to present the headset, he stayed in an Airbnb.
So far in 2012, the area has received almost one million tourists  more than 23,000 of them from outside India.
Its frustrating, admitted Abdullah, who has been in charge of Indias most sensitive state since early 2009.
British citizens have been killed more recently in countries that you still havent stopped people from visiting.
Youve lost them in Spain, in Bali, said Abdullah.
There is still a possibility that al-Qaida could do something stupid, but we havent stopped Indians from travelling to London.
There is no reason to say Jammu and Kashmir, or even Srinagar, is an unsafe destination.
Germany relaxed its guidelines for travellers to the region in 2011.
But there was no trouble at the independence celebrations.
Abdullah is confident that tourists are safe in the state, if you take the normal sort of precautions.
In other words, do not go trekking near the border that separates the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of Kasmir.
Syed Ali Shah Geelani, leader of the pro-Kashmiri independence party, disagrees with Abdullahs politics.
Some visitors may worry about the ethics of having fun in a place where the local people are suffering from record levels of anxiety and mental health problems.
But the locals in Srinagar seem to be in favour of tourism.
We need more for tourists to do in the evening  we dont even have one cinema in this city, he said.
In June, a local Islamic group created a dress code for foreign tourists.
Nobody wants tourists to come here and cover their faces.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge won the first part of their battle for privacy when a French magazine was banned from selling or reusing photos of the couple at a private chateau in Provence.
French prosecutors must now decide if there should be criminal proceedings against the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers who took the pictures of the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of France.
The court decided that every time Mondadori  the publishing company owned by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi  publishes a photograph in the future in France, they will be fined 10,000.
But the decision refers only to the 14 pictures that have already been published.
A source said: They always believed the law was broken and that they had a right to their privacy.
Maud Sobel, a lawyer for the royal couple in Paris, described it as a wonderful decision.
And the Mondadori-owned Italian celebrity magazine Chi published a special edition of 26 pages with the photos of the future queen.           
The governments lawyers said that too much time had passed since the seven-year insurgency in the 1950s and it was no longer possible to hold a fair trial, but the court rejected these claims.
Human rights activists in Kenya estimate more than 5,000 of the 70,000 people detained by the British colonial authorities are still alive.
The Foreign Office said that the ruling had potentially significant legal implications, and said it was planning to appeal.
In this case, that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their view of what happened.
They had been sitting silently with their supporters in a garden and reacted with joy when the word came, hugging, dancing and raising their hands to the sky to pray.
When she was asked what she would tell her four children, she said simply: I will tell them I won.
The judge said in 2011 that there was ample evidence  that there may have been systematic torture of detainees.
A number of veterans of the insurgency in Cyprus in the 1950s watched the case closely.
Any Cypriot claimants could rely not only on British documents, but also on the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva.
Those files are kept secret for 40 years, and then opened to public examination.
Relatives of 24 unarmed rubber plantation workers who were killed by British troops are currently fighting through the British courts for a public inquiry.
Many former prisoners of the British in Aden may also have claims against the British government, although Aden is now part of Yemen, and British lawyers may have problems making contact with possible clients there.       
He has been able to cope with the stigma of being HIV positive  widespread in Liberia  and he was able to access antiretroviral medication, distributed by the Liberian government.
But he could not afford meat and fish  expensive, luxury products in Liberian markets but essential sources of protein.
Pate K Chon, a counsellor who works with HIV sufferers in Liberia, provided a surprising solution.
Since watching a documentary about a fish farm in Thailand several years earlier, she had thought of setting up a similar project in Liberia, allowing HIV sufferers to have work and also access a stable source of protein.
So many of the people I work with dont have the money to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein  it doesnt cause health problems like other sources, and it is something we can farm.
Chon began building a pool in which to farm fish.
The project has now grown into the Grow2Feed Liberia Fish Farm, with 12 tanks, which, when full, will each have 5,000 fish  providing up to 200,000 fish per year, serving a community of 1,200 mainly HIV-positive people, including King and his family.
They can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other essential items.
The fish farm gives these people with HIV a way of getting back into society  now they are trading with people in the market every week.
According to Liberias health survey,1.5% of Liberias 3.5 million people are HIV positive, with 60% of those women or girls.
Research has shown they need much higher levels of protein to stop their health deteriorating and to allow healthy growth.
Fish farming is absolutely possible in Africa, said Paul White, owner of the HydroFish fish farm in Ivory Coast, which produces 3,000 tonnes of fish each year.
Some critics are sceptical of farmed fish, saying fish can be inbred and have high levels of toxins.
But Sheehy said good practice can reduce these problems.
Police and intelligence agencies around the world have, for almost 100 years, used lie detectors to help convict criminals or find spies and traitors.
By contrast, the new method has performed well in experiments.
The basic thought is that liars fidget more and so the use of an all-body motion suit  the kind used in films to create computer-generated characters  will record this.
The suit has 17 sensors that register movement up to 120 times per second in three dimensions for 23 joints.
Anderson said: Guilty people fidget more and we can measure this.
Anderson added that the research had a special significance at this time because of a recent US Senate report on torture by the CIA.
We have known for a long time that torture does not work, Anderson said.
It records changes in pulse, blood pressure, sweating and breathing to find out whether someone is lying.
Some were interviewed about a computer game Never End, which they played for seven minutes.
Some were asked to bring the wallet to a lost-and-found box.
Overall, we correctly guessed whether 82.2% (truths: 88.9%; lies: 75.6%) of the interviewees were telling the truth or lying based on the movements in their individual limbs, the report says.
We found that liars wave their arms more, but this is only at the 60% level that you can get from a polygraph.
That tells truth from lies over 70% of the time and we believe we can improve it even more by combining it with optimal questioning techniques.
The use of all-body suits is expensive  they cost about 30,000  and they can be uncomfortable, so Anderson and his colleagues are now studying low-cost alternatives.
These include using motion-sensing technology from computer games, such as the Kinect devices developed by Microsoft for the Xbox.
This last statistic provides justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global effects of disease.
Knowing how many children die and from what cause allows the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive.
Where they did not have death registries or medical records, for instance, they have taken evidence from verbal autopsies  deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family.
The way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that, in malarial areas, you become semi-immune as an adult, said Dr Christopher Murray, IHME Director.
We need to be very careful in assessing the validity [of the figures], said Colin Mathers, a senior scientist.
His colleague Dr Tiers Boerma, Director of one WHO department, added: People should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO cant go with any academic publication that states a different number.
However, said Mathers, IHME has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses and that is stimulating.
One of the main themes, said Murray, was incredibly rapid change in the main causes of death and the speed of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be.
Reduced fertility and longer life have led to a rise in the average age of the worlds population in a decade from 26 years old to almost 30.
The change has been dramatic in Latin America, for instance, where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010.
That is a 35-year increase in the average age of death over four decades.
In a place like Brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are not able to deal with it, Murray said.
A second factor is the move outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed lifestyle diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer  some of which have significant genetic triggers.
That change has been particularly marked in Latin America, the Middle East and south-east and even south Asia, he said.
They were mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, and disorders, such as arthritis and lower back pain, anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease.
Firstly, when on Mars the astronauts bodies will have to adapt to surface gravity that is 38% of that on Earth.
It is thought that this would cause such a total change in their bone density, muscle strength and circulation that the astronauts would no longer be able to survive in Earths conditions.
Secondly, and directly related to the first, they will have to say goodbye to all their family and friends, as there is no return ticket.
He told The Guardian that the applicants so far ranged in age from 18 to at least 62 and, though they include women, they were mostly men.
I could be one of the pioneers, building the first colony on Mars and teaching people back home that there are still uncharted territories that humans can reach for.
The main attributes Mars One is looking for in astronaut-settlers are resilience, adaptability, curiosity, ability to trust and resourcefulness, according to Kraft.
For instance, water can be taken from ice in the soil and Mars has sources of nitrogen, the primary element in the air we breathe.
The broadcasting revenue from the London Olympics was almost enough to finance a mission to Mars, Lansdorp said.
The aim is to establish a permanent human colony, according to Mars Ones website.
The first team would land on Mars in 2023 to begin building the colony, with a team of four astronauts every two years after that.
Mars One believes it is not only possible but necessary that we establish a permanent colony on Mars in order to speed up our understanding of the formation of the solar system, the origins of life and, of equal importance, our place in the universe, it says.             
All six numbers match, so its time to buy that Audi, book the holiday in the US and phone the estate agent.
At least, thats what most lottery millionaires do, according to a study of spending and investment by jackpot winners.
Since it started in 1994, the UK national lottery has created 3,000 millionaires who have won more than 8.5bn in total, at an average of 2.8m each.
Between them, they have created a further 3,780 millionaires among their children, family and friends, according to the authors of the study, Oxford Economics.
Most winners (59%) give up work straight away, but 19% carry on working and 31% do unpaid voluntary work.
The good news for the economy is that 98% of the money the winners spent remained in the UK.
Winners have contributed almost 750m to gross domestic product (GDP), and generated more than 500m in tax for the Exchequer.
Most winners (82%) changed their main home, spending an average 900,000.
The new home is likely to have a hot tub, with almost a third (29%) putting that on their shopping list.
A walk-in wardrobe was absolutely necessary for 28%, almost a quarter (24%) chose a property behind electric gates, and 22% had a games room, with 7% installing a snooker table.
Andy Logan, author of the report, said: The effect of a win spreads much further and wider than we expected.
Not only does it change the lives of friends and family, but each win has an effect on the UK economy, especially with so much of it being spent in the UK. 
When the Taliban sent a gunman to shoot Malala Yousafzai in October 2012 as she rode home on a bus after school, they knew what they wanted: to silence the teenager and kill off her campaign for girls education.
Nine months and countless surgical operations later, she stood up at the United Nations on her 16th birthday on Friday to give a defiant reply.
She listened quietly as Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, described her as our hero, our champion; and as the former British prime minister and now UN education envoy, Gordon Brown, said what he called the words the Taliban never wanted her to hear: happy 16th birthday, Malala.
The event, named Malala Day, was the culmination of an extraordinary four years for the girl from Mingora in Pakistan.
By 11, she was showing exceptional determination, calling personally on the US special representative to Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, to use his influence against the Talibans efforts to stop education for girls.
By 14, she was on the radar of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who suggested her for the International Childrens Peace Prize, and, by 15, she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee in history.
Malala responded to the violence of the Taliban with words against bullets.
There was one other allusion to the horror of her past: she wore a white shawl belonging to a woman who was also targeted by extremists but who, unlike Malala, did not survive: Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister of Pakistan.
She talked about the attack in June on a hospital in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan, and killings of female teachers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The Stand with Malala petition, demanding education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school, has attracted more than four million signatures  more than a million were added after Malalas speech.
She did not need to worry. 
Galina Zaglumyonova was woken in her flat in central Chelyabinsk by an enormous explosion that blew in the balcony windows and shattered pots containing her houseplants.
When she jumped out of bed, she could see a huge vapour trail hanging in the morning sky and hear car alarms from the street below.
Officials said almost 1,200 people had been injured, with more than 40 taken to hospital  most as a result of flying glass shattered by the sonic boom created by the meteorites fall.
The meteorite entered the atmosphere travelling at a speed of at least 33,000mph and broke up into pieces between 18 and 32 miles above the ground, according to a statement from the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Tatyana Bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite hit.
First we noticed the wind, and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see a cloud of smoke in the sky, she said.
She said a nearby building for college students was particularly badly affected and many of the students were brought in.
The total cost of the damage in the city was being valued at more than one billion roubles (20m).
There were lots of rumours and conspiracy theories, however, in the first few hours after the incident.
The ultra-nationalist leader of Russias Liberal Democrat party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said it was not a meteorite but military action by the United States.
Some were quick to take advantage.
Enterprising people were offering pieces of meteorite for sale through internet sites within a few hours of the impact.
President Vladimir Putin and the Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, were informed about the incident, and Putin called a meeting with the head of the Emergency Situations Ministry.
There comes a time in some mens lives when the days seem darker, death more certain, and the only sensible response is to blow the life savings on a sportscar.
Radical and often ill-advised changes in lifestyle are typical for the midlife crisis but, if it is more than a myth, then humans may not be the only animals to experience it.
Now an international team of scientists claims it has found evidence for a slump in well-being among middle-aged chimpanzees and orangutans.
The findings of the study, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that the midlife crisis may have its roots in the biology humans share with our closest evolutionary cousins.
The team from the US, Japan, Germany and the UK asked zookeepers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals.
The forms included questions about each apes mood, the enjoyment they got from socializing, and their success at achieving certain goals.
The final question asked how zookeepers would feel about being the ape for a week.
The animals well-being was at its lowest, on average, at 28.3 and 27.2 years old for the chimpanzees, and 35.4 years old for the orangutans.
In all three groups we find evidence that well-being is lowest in chimpanzees and orangutans at an age that corresponds more or less to midlife in humans, Weiss said.
Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University, was sceptical about the findings.
Its hard to see anything in an apes life that would have that sort of pattern.
If we want to find the answer to the question of whats going on with the midlife crisis, we should look at what is similar in middle-aged humans, chimps and orangutans, he said.     
The method, called Virtopsy, is now being used at some forensic medical institutes in Europe, after it was pioneered by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich.
Basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more because a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence, he said.
The technique allows you to find injuries that are not seen during a traditional autopsy, as well as air pockets, heart attacks and even cancer.
The Virtopsy might replace the autopsy one day, Richard Dirndorfer, one of the pioneers of DNA analysis in criminology, and a developer of Virtopsy, told the German science magazine PM.
At first, the aim is to use the new method to complement the traditional autopsy.
It will allow forensic scientists to plan their autopsies far more efficiently, Dominic Wichmann, an internal medicine specialist at Hamburgs University Hospital, told Spiegel.
Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the new method.
In order to analyze the colour of the blood, the consistencies (of body fluids) or smells, well need to keep on with the traditional cut, said Lars Oesterhelweg, Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit Hospital in Berlin, which is using a version of the Virtopsy.
The US Senate Intelligence Committee has approved a bill that would make the National Security Agencys bulk collection of US phone records more transparent but allow it to continue.
The bill passed the committee by an 11-4 vote and will now be voted on by the full Senate.
The bill also allows the NSA to continue surveillance that is begun on foreigners outside the US if they enter the country, for a period of up to 72 hours.
The bill is a direct challenge to another bill introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy that would end domestic phone-records collection.
The NSAs surveillance of Americans private information does not respect our constitutional values and needs fundamental reform, Udall said.
The NSA call-records programme is legal, and I believe it contributes to our national security, she said in a statement.
After the committees hearing had ended, Feinstein strongly supported the NSAs main domestic programme.
I think theres huge misunderstanding about this NSA database programme, and how vital it is to protecting this country, she said.
The fundamental question is: should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before collecting Americans most personal information to feed into its databases?
Leahy says yes; Feinstein says no.
The statements that American intelligence officials have made about collecting data from foreign leaders is consistent with the understanding Ive had for years, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, he said.
To everyones surprise, Feinstein announced that she was totally opposed to the foreign leader spying of the sort the NSA conducts on German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Feinstein has been a strong supporter of the NSAs bulk collection of Americans phone records.
According to a top-secret document, the National Security Agency (NSA) has got direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other major US internet companies.
The NSA access is part of a program called PRISM, which allows officials to collect material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, the document says.
Although the document claims that the program is run with the help of the companies, all the companies who responded to a request for comment denied knowledge of any such program.
The NSA access became possible because of changes to US surveillance law, introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012.
The program facilitates a large amount of in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information.
The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating companies who live outside the US, or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US.
The participation of the internet companies in PRISM will add to the debate about the level of surveillance by the intelligence services.
Under US law, companies must comply with requests for users communications, but the PRISM program allows the intelligence services direct access to the companies servers.
The NSA document notes that the operations have the help of communications providers in the US.
The PRISM program allows the NSA, the worlds largest surveillance organization, to get targeted communications without requesting them from the service providers and without needing individual court orders.
This law does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person who is within the United States.
The program is overseen by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch and Congress.
This program was recently reauthorized by Congress after a lot of debate.
What made Nelson Mandela great was exactly what made him human.
The US president said: Through his fierce dignity and strong will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, Madiba transformed South Africa  and moved all of us.
FW de Klerk  the South African president who freed Mandela and shared the Nobel Peace Prize with him in 1993  said the news was deeply sad for South Africa and the world.
In Soweto, people gathered to sing and dance near the house where he once lived.
With South Africa facing possible civil war, Mandela chose reconciliation with the white minority to build a new democracy.
After the Sharpeville massacre, in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police, he took the difficult decision to begin an armed struggle.
Mandelas 91st birthday was marked by the first annual Mandela Day in his honour.
This is very good news, said Maheshwar Dhakal, an ecologist with Nepals Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation.
The census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors.
Dhakal said that a similar survey was done in India and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013.
It will take a few more months for India, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finish the survey, he added.
Nepal has promised to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.
The skin and bones are given to middlemen, who pass easily through the border with India, where the major dealers are based.
One major problem is that some senior officials help mafia networks involved in the trade.
But they say Nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers feed so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.
As the number of tigers has increased over the years, conflict with villagers has increased, too.
But it should also produce plans to protect people from tigers, Krishna Bhurtel, a village headman, told a Nepali newspaper.
Wildlife authorities captured a tiger after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in May.
Diwakar Chapagain, head of a World Wildlife Fund Nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in Tibet, where rich people use them as festival costumes.
In Nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins for special occasions.
Tiger bones are used in traditional Chinese medicines.
The trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets, Chapagain said. 
On the market square in Rjukan stands a statue of the towns founder, a respected Norwegian engineer and businessman called Sam Eyde.
Behind him, to the south, rises the 1,800-metre peak known as Gaustatoppen.
But one thing he couldnt do was change the sun.
grins Ingrid Sparbo, lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes.
Two young mothers bring their children into the square and stand in the sun.
Across the road, in the Nye Tider caf, sits the man who created this unexpected happiness.
The idea of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil, or Sun mirror, came to him at the end of one September: Every day, we would take our young child for a walk, he says, and, every day, I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun.
In the months between September and March, Andersen says, Wed look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain slopes, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town.
Twelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specializing in CSP  concentrated solar power  brought in, by helicopter, the three 17-sq-m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan.
Like many others, he felt that the money should have been spent on other things  on extra carers to look after Rjukans old people, perhaps, or improved school facilities, cycle paths and roads.
In his office overlooking the square, Rjukans young mayor, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town.
A hi-tech company is interested in moving to Rjukan, attracted by the cutting-edge technology at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted.
And, he says, just look out of the window.
Now its here, people love it.   
Barack Obama flew back to Washington and his desk in the Oval Office on Wednesday, hours after delivering an election victory speech in Chicago in which he asked the country to unite behind him.
Unlike after his election in 2008, the President is unlikely to get a honeymoon period.
While Obama easily beat his Republican opponent Mitt Romney, holding swing state after swing state, the election showed again how divided America remains.
While the inauguration is not until January, in effect Obama started his second term on Wednesday.
Having disappointed many supporters in his first term, he now wants to establish a legacy that will transform him from a middling president into a great one.
He talked about the need for both parties to find common ground and take steps together to help our economy grow and create jobs, which is critical to solving our debt.
Reid, also sounded conciliatory, saying: I look at the challenges that we have ahead of us and I reach out to my Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House.
The trouble will come when talks move to detail: the Republicans want to protect military spending while the Democrats want cuts.
Obama wants tax increases on households earning more than $250,000; Boehner has rejected any tax increases.
But now that he has won, he returned to famous lines from earlier speeches, such as his 2008 slogan about hope.
Obama told the ecstatic crowd of supporters: Tonight in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back.
In a speech that lasted more than 25 minutes, Obama paid emotional tribute to his wife, Michelle, and his daughters, Malia and Sasha  as well as to his Vice-President, Joe Biden.
He said, This is a time for great challenges for America and I pray the President will be successful in guiding our nation.
Historically, it would have been a disappointment for African Americans and many white liberals if the first black presidency had ended in failure.         
Sweden is the best country for older people, Afghanistan the worst  but the general wealth of a country does not always mean better conditions for the over-60s, according to the first global index on ageing.
Swedens top ranking  followed by Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada  is predictable, but the Global AgeWatch index provides some surprising results.
This survey shows that history counts, said Mark Gorman, director of HelpAge International.
The top-ranked countries are what you would expect, but Scandinavian countries were not wealthy when they introduced pensions for everyone.
Everybody has scarce resources, but they should not forget that, when they make investment decisions, they should also consider issues of old age.
The index, developed with the UN Fund for Population and Development, covers 91 countries and 89% of the worlds older people.
Population ageing  when older people form an increasingly large proportion of people  is happening fastest in developing countries.
There are gender differences among ageing populations, with women generally living longer than men.
Many women face disadvantages in old age because of lack of paid work (and therefore also savings), less decision-making power in the family and the fact that they are vulnerable to violence.
However, population ageing does not always lead to significantly higher health care spending, according to the report, which highlights the importance of long-term investments in education and health care for older people.
Bolivia, ranked 46, despite being one of the poorest countries, has introduced good policies for older people, with a national plan on ageing, free health care and a noncontributory pension for everyone.
Good basic health care introduced decades ago in Chile and Costa Rica has helped the ageing populations of those countries.
A good education system is of great benefit later in life  basic literacy is crucial for older people as they deal with the pensions paperwork.
The same is true for Armenia, which, like other countries of the former Soviet Union, benefited from a strong education system.
The ageing index is calculated using 13 indicators under four headings: income security, health care, employment and education, and a positive environment.
These categories have increased importance because of better data quality and countries were included only if there was enough data.
Professor Sir Richard Jolly, creator of the human development index, said: This groundbreaking index helps us to better understand the needs and opportunities of older people thanks to its pioneering application of human development methodology.
The aim of the scheme has always been to respect the wishes of the deceased; however, relatives or friends may object to consent.
When family members know that organ donation is what the deceased wanted, they usually agree to the donation.
The new law will work by making clearer peoples wishes around the issue of organ donation and it will increase the rate of consent to donation.
The issue is controversial  opponents are worried that the urgent need for more kidneys and hearts will lead to hospitals overruling the wishes of those who have died and their family.
We have the problem of not having enough organs for people who need them, said Drakeford.
The British Medical Association has campaigned for a long time for an opt-out system because it is worried about the growing number of people who need transplants.
Members of the Muslim Council of Wales and the South Wales Jewish Representative Council have expressed worries, while the Archbishop of Wales, Barry Morgan, said that donation ought to be a gift of love, of generosity.
Among those present was a Mexican cardinal, Monsignor Oscar Sanchz Barba, from Guadalajara.
We were all in the Sala del Concistoro  of the Apostolic Palace, he said.
We were all left   Sanchz Barba looked around him in St Peters Square, looking for the word; he was as speechless as the princes of the church who had just heard the man they believe to be Gods representative on earth give up the job.
Before going on to assure the Pope of the cardinals loyalty and devotion, he said he and the others present had listened to you with a sense of confusion, almost completely incredulous.
John Thavis, who spent 30 years reporting on the Vatican and whose book, The Vatican Diaries, is soon to be published, said he had had a feeling the Pope might be about to resign and timed his return to Rome from the US accordingly.
Thavis noted that in the long interview Benedict gave to a German journalist in 2010, he had made it clear he considered it would be right to go if he felt he could no longer do the job.
He has completed his series of books and most of his projects.
There will no doubt be other theories in the days and weeks ahead, just as there were following the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978, 33 days after his election.
Already there is speculation that some information was about to come out about Benedicts past.
Coming out of St Peters Basilica, Julia Rochester, from London, who described herself as a lapsed Catholic, was still considering the implications of the Popes resignation.
It is a question many Catholics will be asking their priests in the weeks ahead. 
He also told of his disdain for and distrust of some sections of the media and described how his father constantly reminded him to behave more like a member of the royal family.
A commander of the armys most sophisticated attack helicopter, the prince said he had shot at the Taliban during operations to support ground troops and rescue injured Afghan and NATO personnel.
One in the army, one socially in my own private time and one with the family.
He admitted he sometimes let himself down with his laddish behaviour, which he said was probably because he is too much army and not enough prince, but he said he was entitled to privacy, too.
He said he was particularly annoyed by articles comparing his role as an Apache co-pilot gunner to Spitfire crews during the second world war.
The prince said his suspicion of the media came from the treatment of his family when I was very small, but that he couldnt stop reading the stories written about him.
But all it does is just upset me and anger me that people can get away with writing the stuff they do.
Four years ago, the prince had to be taken out of Afghanistan during his first tour after a media silence was broken by mistake by an Australian magazine.
Two-man crews from the BBC, Sky and ITN were sent once each to report on his visit.
When he was asked where he and his brothers fascination with helicopters came from, he said, Probably the fact that you can only fit a certain number of people in a helicopter, therefore no one can follow us, like you guys.     
These experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated, direct communication connection between brains, Nicolelis said.
The scientists first demonstrated that rats can share, and act on, each others sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach the part of the brain that processes movement.
The rats were taught to press a lever when a light went on above it.
When they did the task correctly, they got a drink of water.
Only one compartment had a light above the lever.
In tests, the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals and pressed the lever 70% of the time.
If the receiving rat failed at the task, the first rat did not get the reward of a drink, and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner.
In the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and used the internet to send their brain activity back and forth.
Nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to connect several animals brains at once to solve more complex tasks.
In theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could find solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves.
Anders Sandberg, who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at Oxford University, said the work was very important in helping to understand how brains encode information.
Often, we dont want to reveal those drafts, because that would be embarrassing and confusing.
Richard died at Bosworth on 22 August 1485, the last English king to die in battle, and, for the first time, the researchers revealed how.
But many of the other injuries were after death, suggesting that the kings naked body was mutilated as it was brought back to Leicester.
One terrible injury was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour.
Bob Savage, a medieval weapons expert, said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried.
Michael Ibsen, the Canadian-born furniture maker proved to be the descendant of Richards sister, heard the confirmation on Sunday and listened to the evidence in shocked silence.
Although it is not certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs, there may be more DNA detective work to be done there.     
The birth of the baby prince means the monarchy has three generations of heirs to the throne for the first time since 1894  The baby is the first Prince of Cambridge to be born for more than 190 years since Prince George of Cambridge, a grandson of George III and the only son of Prince Adolphus Frederick, the 1st Duke of Cambridge.
Following tradition, a formal notice was posted on an easel  the same used to announce Prince Williams birth in 1982  in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace shortly before 9pm.
Within an hour, the numbers had swelled from hundreds to thousands outside the palace, with locals and tourists wanting to share in the historic moment.
It is an important moment in the life of our nation but, above all, it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy.
May God bless them all with love, health and happiness, he said.
Felix Baumgartner stood at the edge of space above New Mexico and paused slightly.
But they decided to go ahead, watched by a record 8 million people live on YouTube.
After a two-and-a-half-hour journey up, during which the curvature of the Earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black, the descent was much quicker.
Three cameras, which were attached to Baumgartners suit, recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes and then the parachute opening.
He had already done two practice free-falls in preparation for this jump  one from 71,000 feet and a second from 97,000 feet.
He was trying to break five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history.
The stunt was planned for seven years, was sponsored by Red Bull drinks, and beat two of Kittingers records: before, the retired US air force colonel held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting.
He added: The most beautiful moment was when I was standing on the landing area and Mike Todd [the life support engineer who dressed Baumgartner in his suit] appeared and he had a smile on his face like a little kid.
Baumgartner said that he felt like Todds son, adding: He was so happy that I was alive.
Earlier, Todd had told the press conference: The world needs a hero right now, and theyve got one in Felix Baumgartner.
He has promised to settle down and enjoy life with his girlfriend, Nicole Oetl, flying helicopters on rescue missions in the US and Austria.   
Currently the beach just has an access road filled with camper vans from Germany, France, Italy and Britain, which bring windsurfers and kitesurfers who are attracted by the strong winds in the area.
Environmental and conservation groups have protested that the project will harm the habitats of protected species, but for most of the council the issue is simple: jobs.
The Socialist opposition in Madrid attacked the idea, and Galindo said it discriminated against migrant workers who came to Spain during the boom years, many of them from Morocco, whose coastline is just 14km away and can be seen from Tarifa.
Surfers fear that new buildings in Valdevaqueros would reduce the strength of the famous local wind but fail to attract traditional package holidaymakers.
Campaigners say it also has a vital role for migrating animals.
Money is once again more important than urban laws and European environmental directives, said Ral Romeva, a member of the European Parliament.
Many locals are also wondering why a resort should be built 10km away, and not on wasteland near Tarifas picturesque old centre, with its typically Andalusian white walls and small streets, dominated by a 10th-century Moorish castle.
We agree with the complex as long as it creates jobs in the town, but we are against it if it only benefits a few, said Cristbal Lobato, who has worked at the same beachside bar in Tarifa for 30 years.
What they want to do is turn this into Benidorm, but what attracts people here is wildlife and the wind.
The direct action group UK Uncut plans to turn dozens of the coffee empires UK outlets into crches, refuges and homeless shelters to highlight Starbucks tax avoidance tactics.
When he appears before the committee, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer, Troy Alstead, will attempt to repair the companys reputation.
MPs accused the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the UKs tax department, of having cosy relationships with big businesses.
The campaign group UK Uncut wants to show a connection between government cuts, in particular those that affect women, and tax avoidance by multinational businesses.
Sarah Greene, a UK Uncut activist, said funding for refuges and rape crisis centres would be reduced unless companies paid the fair amount of tax.
Uncut campaigner Anna Walker said Weve chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women.
So were going to focus on transforming Starbucks into those services that the government are cutting, such as refuges and crches.
The coffee store chain, Starbucks, insists it pays the correct level of taxes.
The group Chief Executive, Howard Schultz, has said in a statement: Starbucks has always paid taxes in the UK.
Over the last three years alone, our company has paid more than 160m in various taxes, including National Insurance*, VAT and business rates.
Margaret Hodge, who leads the Public Accounts Committee, told parliament last month that Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google and Starbucks had avoided nearly 900m of tax.
We do need to make sure we continue to encourage these businesses to invest in our country, but they should be paying fair taxes as well.
A spokeswoman for Starbucks said: While the subject of tax law can be extremely complex, Starbucks respects and obeys tax laws and accounting rules in each of the 61 countries where we do business, including the UK.
When you consider the indirect employment created by Starbucks investments in the UK, the companys extended economic impact to the UK economy is more than 80m a year.     
But, in fact, each year the global number of deaths caused by bacterial resistance is far more than the number of deaths caused by terrorist attacks.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, life expectancy in the UK was around 47 years of age for a man and 50 for a woman, a number heavily affected by the very high rate of infant mortality in those days.
However, a child born in Britain today has more than a one in four chance of reaching their 100th birthday.
In our hospitals and our GP surgeries, we have abused the drugs that gave us such a huge advantage over infectious disease  we use them too often.
We thought that antibiotic therapy was an advantage we could enjoy forever.
New, more resistant species have been found.
Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (VRSA) appeared in our hospitals.
Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop, that are only used in short courses and that quickly become ineffective due to the changes in bacterial resistance.
Since the first MRSA deaths in healthy children in the US in 1998, the number of deaths from MRSA infection in the US each year has increased to tens of thousands  far more than the number of deaths caused by AIDS.
Bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere.
And we have to find a way to convince the pharmaceutical companies to develop these less profitable drugs.
The head of Swedens prison and probation service, Nils Oberg, said in November 2013 that four Swedish prisons will close due to an out of the ordinary fall in prisoner numbers.
Although there has been no fall in crime rates, between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6% fall in Swedens prisoner population, now a little over 4,500.
But, after a number of escapes in 2004, we had to place more emphasis on security.
Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to keep prison sentences short wherever possible by using community-based measures.
The overall reoffending rate in Sweden is between 30 and 40% over three years  to compare that with another European country, the number is around half that of the UK.
In the UK, for example, children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 have the highest reoffending rates.
One strong reason for the fall in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in Sweden.
The service is helped by around 4,500 members of the public who volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision.
He was helped by an organization run by other former prisoners called Kris (Criminals Return Into Society).
Both organizations work with the same goal: helping prisoners successfully fit back into society after they have been released.
With X-Cons, we meet them at the prison gate and support them into accommodation and offer a network of support.
Of course, there are some people who will not or cannot change.
But, in my experience, the majority of prisoners want to change and we must do what we can to help them.     
Actually you do get used to it after a while, said George, an IT technician.
That usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by the opposition on YouTube.
In the centre of town, a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of explosions.
Zeina, a twentysomething student, is afraid she might become desensitized to suffering  and perhaps to danger too.
In February, reports say that 80 people, including schoolchildren, died near the ruling Baath Party headquarters in Mazraa.
You can still see the crater, marked by an enormous patch of fresh asphalt on the main road going north.
There has been increased security since the bombing of the national security crisis cell in July 2012, when four of Assads most senior aides were killed.
Concrete blast barriers  often painted in the Syrian flags black, red and white  now protect official buildings, not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets.
Checkpoints on main roads stop traffic for ID checks and baggage searches with handheld explosive detectors  vital to stop future bombers.
One view is that the fight for Syrias capital is coming, but not quite yet  in the summer perhaps, some predict, when the rebels have made further progress in the south.
But few people here seem to expect things to get any better.     
At Addis Ababa airport, visitors are greeted by pictures of golden grains, tiny red seeds and a group of men around a giant pancake.
Ethiopia is one of the worlds poorest countries, well known for its difficult food situation.
But it is also the home of teff, a highly nutritious ancient grain that is now being sold in health-food shops and supermarkets in Europe and America.
Teffs tiny seeds  the size of poppy seeds  are high in calcium, iron and protein, and also amino acids.
Naturally gluten free, the grain can be used instead of wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases.
Across the country, and in neighbouring Eritrea, people gather around large pieces of injera, which is also used as cutlery, scooping up stews and feeding one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship  a tradition known as gursha.
The growing appetite for traditional crops and the booming health-food and gluten-free markets are breathing new life into the grain, which is increasingly being called Ethiopias second gift to the world, after coffee.
Sophie Kebede, a London-based businesswoman who owns a UK company specializing in the grain, says she was flabbergasted when she discovered its nutritional value.
In Bolivia and Peru, there are reports of rising incomes from the now-global quinoa trade, but also malnutrition and conflicts over land, as farmers sell their entire crop to meet western demand.
It says that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes, and help reduce malnutrition  particularly among children and adolescents.
The governments Agricultural Transformation Agency aims to boost crops by developing improved varieties of the grain and introducing new planting techniques and tools.
Mama Fresh is a family company that has been selling injera to top restaurants and hotels in the Ethiopian capital for years.
But, the company wants to double exports to America in 2014 and will soon start producing teff-based pizzas, bread and cookies.
Regassa Feyissa, an Ethiopian agricultural scientist and former head of the National Institute for Biodiversity, warns that, without careful planning, increased teff production for export may mean that farmers do not grow other important crops.
With not much Ethiopian teff on the international market, farmers in the US have started planting the crop.
The British government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral at St Pauls Cathedral.
He added: As our first woman prime minister, Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and she didnt just lead our country, she saved our country.
In a statement, President Barack Obama said, Here in America, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with President Reagan, reminding the world that we can shape the currents of history with our moral beliefs, courage and iron will.
Thatcher, who was 87, had been in poor health for some years, suffering from dementia.
The Labour Party disagreed with a lot of what she did and she will always be a controversial figure.
The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said: Margaret Thatcher was one of the most important figures in modern British politics.
Describing her as a political phenomenon, the former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major said: Her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.
The Iron Lady was a cold war ally of the US president Ronald Reagan in the final showdown with the Soviet Union, which broke up as a result of reformist pressures led by Mikhail Gorbachev, a Kremlin leader with whom Thatcher famously said she could do business.
Thatcher was an unremarkable Conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975.
After she retired, she wrote highly successful memoirs and campaigned energetically for the Thatcher Foundation, which aimed to promote her values around the world.       
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked the USA to sort out its finances after the US avoided a debt default and hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after a 16-day government shutdown.
As the US President, Barack Obama, warned, Weve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis, the IMFs managing director, Christine Lagarde, asked for more stability.
Stock markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea first showed relief after the Republicans finally capitulated in their failed attempt to undermine Obamas healthcare reforms.
Chinas official Xinhua News Agency accused the US of jeopardizing other countries dollar assets.
It offers a temporary solution, funding the government until 15 January and raising the debt limit until 7 February.
But the president made clear that he did not expect another serious budget fight and shutdown in 2014.
At the White House, Obama said he hoped the deal would lift the cloud of uncertainty that had hung over the country in recent weeks.
However, the political deal was one of the worst of all possible results for Republicans.
None of their goals was achieved and polls showed that voters blamed them for the crisis.     
According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), 35.6% of all women around the world will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, usually from a male partner.
It also finds that a large proportion of murders of women  38%  are carried out by their partners.
However, wealthier nations are not always safer for women  a third of women in high-income countries (32.7%) will experience violence at some stage in their lives.
42% of the women who experience violence suffer injuries, which can bring them to the attention of healthcare staff.
That, says the report, is often the first opportunity for violence in the home to be discovered and for the woman to be offered help.
Violence has a significant effect on womens health.
For the first time, we have compared data from all over the world on the extent of partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the impact of these sorts of violence on health, said Garcia-Moreno.
These included HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, alcoholism, unwanted pregnancies and lowbirthweight babies.
The authors say that their previous research shows that better-educated women and working women are less likely to suffer violence, although not in all regions.
There is a need to question social norms, said Watts.
Over the past ten years, there has been increasing recognition of the problem, she said, but we have to recognize that it is a complex problem.
The new WHO clinical and policy guidelines recommend healthcare staff should be trained to recognize the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault, but they do not recommend general screening  that is, asking every woman who arrives in a clinic whether she has been subjected to violence.
But, if you see a woman coming back several times with injuries she doesnt mention, you should ask about domestic violence, said Garcia-Moreno.
Years later, I was sometimes in a situation where I could tell there was something else wrong with the woman I was interviewing, but didnt know that domestic violence was the issue.
Now, I think I would do the interview very differently.   
But, on Tuesday April 8th, 2014, she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he had thrown it into the Baltic Sea.
The bottle is believed to be the worlds oldest message in a bottle and it was presented to Erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in Germany.
It was very surprising, Erdmann, 62, said, describing how she found out about the bottle.
Her visitor was a genealogical researcher who had managed to find her in Berlin after the letter was given to a museum in the northern port city of Hamburg.
The brown beer bottle, which had been in the water for 101 years, was found by a fisherman, who had been out in the Baltic Sea off the northern city of Kiel.
Holger von Neuhoff, a curator at the museum, said this bottled message was the oldest he had come across.
Researchers believe Erdmanns grandfather, Richard Platz, threw the bottle in the sea while on a hike in 1913.
Erdmann said she also liked culture and travelling around the world, just like her grandfather.
Sleep deprivation used to be a sign that you were busy and important and very much in demand.
Sleep was for wimps.
Luxury hotels are offering sleep retreats; more than $1,000 gets you dinner and a movie about sleep.
And, if youre staying home, you can upgrade your bedroom with everything from a mattress cover with a sensor that monitors your sleep ($249) to a sleeping mask that monitors your brainwaves and lets you nap more efficiently ($299).
A number of companies already have sleeping areas and Huffington predicts that nap rooms in offices are going to become as common as conference rooms in the next two years.
How did sleep, something humans have done since long before Huffington, suddenly become so fashionable?
Our bodies have become machines that we monitor and optimize for greater efficiency and sleep has become another data set to be monitored.
They run her errands, plan her travel and load The Huffington Post on her computer in the morning.
Numerous studies show that youre more likely to sleep badly if youre poor.
Do you know who gets the most sleep and the best quality of sleep in America?
The very real sleep crisis isnt that a few rich people think its a waste of time; the problem is the 99% who cant afford to spend time sleeping.
The real prize is finding a way to negate sleep deprivation so humans can work on less sleep.
It examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their peak with only a couple of hours sleep.
This would lead to a twofold decrease in the casualty rate.
The brand value of the Silicon Valley firm, already the worlds biggest company, has increased by 21% in 12 months, according to the Interbrand Best Global Brands annual report.
Apple, which is recognized all over the world by its simple Apple with a bite missing logo, led an increase of technology companies in the 2014 report, which has pushed more traditionally valuable brands  such as Coca-Cola, McDonalds and Gillette  down the table.
Jez Frampton, chief executive of Interbrand, said: Benefitting immensely from the rise of digital and mobile technology, savvy brands like Apple grew stronger.
A Chinese company has got into the top 100 for the first time, with mobile-phone and broadband firm Huawei entering the table in 94th place with a brand value of $4.3bn.
The highest-placed non-US brands are South Koreas Samsung (6th), Japans Toyota (8th) and Germanys Mercedes-Benz (10th).
Customers expect interaction, responsiveness, 24/7 accessibility, customization options and high levels of personalization, he said.   
But, for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit, Nunavut, life in the land of the midnight sun is a real challenge during the month of Ramadan, when Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset.
I havent fainted once, said 29-year-old Abdul Karim, one of the few in the area who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun since moving from Ottawa in 2011.
Most Muslims in Iqaluit follow the timetable followed by Muslims in Ottawa, about 1,300 miles south  this follows the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city.
It still means fasting for around 18 hours a day, said Atif Jilani, who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto.
In recent years, much of the community has chosen to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton, in Alberta.
Some follow the timings of Mecca, for example Awan, a father of two young children, including a 12-year-old who recently started fasting.
If I fast Edmonton times, my son might say, Papa, you are really insane.
For the 100 or so Muslims in Inuvik, a small town 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle, it is impossible to follow the local movements of the sun.
They were already following the Edmonton schedule in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern community of 3,500 people.
At times, it can be difficult to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside, Alkhalaf said.
In Inuvik, where most of the population is Inuit, the Muslim community has tried to strike a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions.
In Iqaluit, as the Muslim community prepares to mark the end of Ramadan, some reflect that 2016s timing  stretching across some of the longest days of the year  has made it one of the more difficult of recent years.
Its particularly true for those like Karim who have followed the local sunrise and sunset carefully.
But, his efforts will be rewarded in future years, said Karim, thanks to the lunar calendar.
MOOCs have no enrolment criteria and no fees, so students behave very differently from students on traditional higher education courses.
One way of making a return on the investment might be studying data about how, why and when millions of students sign up, interact with their material, submit their assignments, message each other and drop out of the course.
Students in developing countries who want access to first-world universities?
People without qualifications who want to use MOOCs as a bridge to higher education?
Or hobby learners, who want to learn about a subject area in which they have an interest?
Learning online is a different thing and needs quite advanced learning skills, confirms David Kernohan, progamme manager for eLearning Innovation at a charity that promotes the use of digital technologies in UK education and research.
With MOOCs, theres very little support available: the student does not get any individual attention.
Instead, they get peer support, such as online discussion forums.
Although this may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without high-level qualifications, it suggests, he says, that MOOCs could be a really good tool for continuing education.
Mike Sharples, chair of Educational Technology, doesnt agree with that cynicism.
He believes that enrolling international students onto university courses is only a secondary objective of MOOCs  but they could certainly be a very clever marketing idea, as he observes that if 20,000 people sign up to a MOOC  well, you only need 20 of those to enrol afterwards to run a masters.
The real challenge is to allow those countries not just to study MOOCs, but also to create them.   
An international agreement to improve safety in Bangladeshs clothing factories could face legal action because factory owners are demanding compensation for the cost of closures and repair work.
Some repair programmes are expected to take months and factory owners say they cannot pay staff while factories are closed, as well as paying for major works needed to ensure that buildings are safe.
The building repairs are happening in the wake of the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka, in 2013, in which 1,138 people were killed.
The factory owner said that the Accord agreement had pussyfooted around the issue of who paid for factory closures because they just wanted to get as many brands as possible to sign up to a deal in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster.
He said there was no clear process in place to pay the costs involved.
Twelve factories have been identified by the Accord as needing significant work so far, but Holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure and production could continue on other floors.
The Accord also legally requires brands to ensure that workers are paid during factory closures.
She said the detail on who would make payments had been left open in order to ensure that all those factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers made the necessary payments.
However, pressure on the Accord to contribute to the payment of displaced workers has increased after a rival factory-safety group, backed by US retailers including Walmart and Gap, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, set aside $5m to help pay factory workers for up to two months while buildings are improved.
On its corrugated iron walls are educational charts  letters of the alphabet and a map of Bangladesh.
But, it is hard to concentrate  there is the constant sound of hammering and chemicals in the air that stick in the back of the throat and irritate the eyes.
Once they are in primary school, the children get help with their homework at the centres.
The urban development centres aim to make the communities more positive about education and change their cultural mindset towards the children, says SOHAYs programme manager, Mohammed Abdullah al-Mamun.
SOHAY also has sessions for parents and employers to discourage child labour and offers skills training to increase family income.
Getting working children into formal education is really very difficult, says Mamun.
But, after her introduction to education at one of SOHAYs centres, she now goes to a state primary school.
Her father works in a rickshaw garage and her mother is a domestic worker, but they wanted their daughter to go to school.
In 2015, SOHAY helped 1,540 children to leave hazardous work and 2,125 more children  those in danger of starting work  into school.
The Labour Law of Bangladesh 2006 does not allow children under the age of 14 to work but, according to the UN childrens agency, UNICEF, 4.7 million children under that age are employed and 1.3 million aged five to 17 work in hazardous industries.
The organization talked to the community about why it was important for children to go to school.
They chose community volunteers who wanted to change childrens lives and formed groups with social workers, community leaders, mothers, young volunteers and the local government.
Children are just passing their time without education and waiting to do hazardous work.
On the final day of his last visit to Britain as US president, Obama told 500 youth leaders at a meeting in London: Im here to ask you to reject the idea that there are forces we cant control.
Obama said he was proud of his healthcare reforms, which received huge cheers from the audience, and said of the US response to the 2008 financial crisis: Saving the world from great depression  that was quite good.
Questioned on the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), he said: The answer to globalization is not to pull up the drawbridge, though he said it is crucial to pay attention to workers rights.
Before Obama arrived, Tanya Williams, a community officer, told the Guardian: I love Michelle but I like Barack Obama and its exciting to have the chance to hear someone who has changed so much and encouraged so many people who didnt vote before to vote for the first time.
Obama ended the session by taking a question from a young Sikh Londoner, who asked about the problem of racial profiling at airports and being mistaken for a Muslim.
I visited a mosque a few months ago and said our greatest allies are American Muslims who are integrated, he said.
Furqan Naeem, a campaigner from Manchester, said: I recently visited the United States and I saw some really important work the president did  the work celebrated Americas diversity and brought communities together.
Kenny Imafidon, the managing director of a youth organization, said afterwards: What I will remember is what he said about meeting with people who have different politics from you and having to make compromises.
When he was asked if they talked about the debate on Britains membership of the EU, Corbyn said they discussed it briefly.
Obama ended the day at a dinner with the British prime minister and the US ambassador, Matthew Barzun, before travelling to Germany.       
With metadata on peoples calls and texts, but not the content of the communications, two scientists at Stanford University worked out peoples names, where they lived and the names of their partners.
Other data told them about a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis.
The results show the extraordinary power of telephone metadata  that is, the number called, when and for how long  particularly when you use it together with public information from services such as Google, Yelp and Facebook.
Stewart Baker, the former general counsel at the US National Security Agency (NSA), said Metadata tells you everything about somebodys life.
Now, we have hard evidence we can point to that we didnt have in the past, he said.
For the study, 823 people agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an Android app.
Then, using a simple computer program to analyse peoples call patterns, the scientists could see who was in a relationship.
Pigeon skeletons lie among shattered mirrors and water streams through broken walls.
It is one of ten mansions in the middle of The Bishops Avenue that have stood almost completely vacant since they were bought a quarter of a century ago, it is believed for members of the Saudi Arabian royal family.
Nature has taken over and owls have moved in.
It is a sad scene repeated up and down the avenue that Lloyds Bank has calculated is the second most expensive street in Britain.
While more and more people struggle to get on to Londons property ladder as house prices rise at 11.2% a year, 16 mansions on the most expensive part of The Bishops Avenue are empty, many behind locked gates, their overgrown grounds guarded by dogs.
Across the street stands another derelict mansion, worth 18m, with smashed windows and walls painted with anti-climb paint.
The sight of the derelict properties can be agonizing for people who are struggling to keep a roof above their heads in one of the worlds most expensive cities.
One security guard who works on the avenue said it was exasperating to see so many properties  enough to house dozens of people  falling apart.
Now, Chinese house hunters are following Russians and Kazakhs who have spent millions to get an address that estate agents tell them is as world famous as the Champs Elyses and Rodeo Drive.
Inside one mansion, water drips through a huge crystal chandelier onto a thick carpet rotting under sections of collapsed ceiling.
Moss grows through shattered bricks and mirrored tiles are lying on a bathroom floor.
The swimming pool is filled with dirty water and has flowers growing through its tiles.
Unopened wooden boxes marked bullet-proof glass show the security fears of the previous owners.
Magdy Adib Ishak-Hannah, whose personal wealth is 45m, said he was in the minority of permanent residents.
The multimillion-pound ruins are evidence of a property culture in which the worlds richest people see British property as investments.
Nevertheless, the talk on the avenue is about building 5m apartments, instead of 50m mansions, in an effort to bring people back.
I just picked it up, Louise Haggerty, a 56-year-old hairdresser and waitress, said at the end of her trip to the Black Friday sales at one oclock in the morning.
One of those lads was Andy Blackett, 30, who had two trolleys full of bargains.
Someone snatched my telly from me  its because Im the smaller one.
Blackett, Fischer and some friends had driven to Sainsburys at 12.45am after leaving the bedlam of a Tesco 24-hour supermarket, where the Black Friday sale started at midnight.
Meanwhile, Manchester Police said that at least two people had been arrested at Black Friday sales events.
South Wales Police also received a number of calls from staff at Tesco stores after they became concerned due to the number of people who had turned up to sale events.
In her basket was a pint of milk and a loaf of bread.
Its crazy having the sale at midnight  the police must have more important things to do at night than come to sales.
Experts fear that restaurants and caterers hear so many people say that they have allergies (which can be dangerous for the individual), when in fact they have a food intolerance (which is not dangerous), that they may not take all the precautions they should take when serving a person who has a genuine allergy.
There have been a number of fatalities where people have gone to a restaurant, told staff that they have an allergy to a particular food and the meal has been served up containing that allergen.
They include a home-testing kit that looks for specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against foods in the blood.
These antibodies are part of the immune systems response to infections but the best medical evidence has shown that high IgG levels do not suggest an allergy, the guide says.
It attempts to measure electronic resistance across the skin while the child or adult holds the suspect food in their hand.
Hair sample testing is also pointless, the guide says.
Hair is not involved in allergic reactions so testing hair samples cannot provide any useful information on allergies.
The belief that a childs chronic lack of energy or headaches or eczema are caused by an allergy takes a long time and many tests to prove or disprove.
It is tempting to go to an alternative therapist who will do one test and provide a quick, but wrong, answer.
The people waiting outside are the lucky ones.
Instead, they decide to use their powerful telescopes to observe Jupiter and Venus and, later, to pick out stars such as Capella and Betelgeuse.
Fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the UKs growing astrotourism industry.
The 2013 Star Count revealed that only 5% of the UK population can see more than 31 stars on a clear night.
In Northumberland Dark Sky Park, as the area was renamed, it is so dark that Venus casts a shadow on the Earth.
He is planning Britains first astrovillage, one that would contain the largest public observatory in the world and have a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes.
The multimillion-pound project would also have a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory.
Since Exmoor was designated Europes first International Dark Sky Reserve  one level below Dark Sky Park  in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up.
The UK has a long way to go to rival northern Chile, which has more than a dozen tourist observatories and some of the clearest skies in the world.
But Fildes believes that, most importantly, people are starting to appreciate what lies above.
Guillaume Chapron from Swedens University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across Europe found wolves, in some cases, living in suburban areas alongside up to 3,050 people per square kilometre.
The population density of the Scottish Highlands is just nine people per sq km.
Im not saying its a peace-and-love story  coexistence often means conflict  but its important to manage that conflict and resolve the problems it causes.
The reasons for its success in Europe include political stability, growing populations of prey species such as wild deer, and financial support for nonlethal livestock protection such as electric fences, which mean that farmers do not have to shoot wild predators.
Most crucial, said Chapron, has been the EU Habitats Directive, which has forced member states to protect and revive rare species.
The revival was welcomed by author George Monbiot, who is launching Rewilding Britain, a new charity to encourage the return of wild landscape and extinct species.
It is great to see this trend continuing but Britain is completely anomalous  weve lost more of our large mammals than any country except for Ireland, he said.
Apart from the accidental reintroduction of wild boar, weve done almost nothing, whereas in much of the rest of Europe weve got bears, lynx and wolves coming back.
The survey found that the Eurasian lynx lives permanently in 11 population groups in 23 European countries and only five of these were native populations.
If it works in the rest of Europe, theres absolutely no reason why it cant work in the UK, he said.
Theres no reason why we cant have a similar return of wildlife in the UK. 
If we come every day, maybe our dreams will come true, says Kamal, a refugee from Sudans Darfur district who comes to three or four hours of classes every day.
The 29-year-old electrical engineer is one of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of refugees living in the jungle camp outside Calais who have applied for asylum in France and really want to learn the language of what they hope will be their new home.
France is already home to more than a quarter of a million refugees, according to United Nations data  this is more than twice as many as the UK, even though the countries have similar populations.
But, while the applicants wait to hear if they can stay, France does not give them any financial support or allow them to work  and the slow process can take many months.
The idea for the school was first suggested by some of the asylum seekers at the start of the summer, when they were bored with sitting around waiting and nervous about starting a new life in France totally unable to communicate.
It opened within weeks, on 11 July.
The tiny classroom can hold 30 pupils, crammed into five rows of desks in front of a big green chalkboard and pictures of cartoon animals for each letter of the French alphabet.
French is not as easy as English but, two weeks ago, I decided there was no way to get to the UK, says George, another Darfur refugee and student.
Jenny Flahaut, 33, who works at a childrens home, volunteered after seeing an advertisement on Facebook.
She is angry about the depiction of migrants in the media and about politicians who have never visited the camp, most recently David Cameron, the British prime minister, who talked about swarms of people trying to reach the UK.
They dont know them; they are not like that, Flahaut said as she prepared for an afternoon lesson.
The teachers and Zimarco are focused, now, on setting up a separate classroom for around 200 women and two dozen children.
When Larry Pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: Why would anyone want to screw up a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?
Others in the bike industry agree.
Familiar brands including Trek, Raleigh and Specialized all offer electric models and they believe that the market is about to take off.
Electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which rely on motorized power; they are bicycles that can be pedalled with  or without  help from an electric motor.
While cheaper models sell for as little as $700, Court Rye, the founder and editor of ElectricBikeReview.com, a popular website, says riders should expect to pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery.
Companies like Bosch, the German electronics giant, and Shimano, the leading manufacturer of bicycle gears, are entering the business.
Perhaps most importantly, more cities are building cycling infrastructure including bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular.
Electric bikes make commuting more practical  and fun  by reducing worry about hills, headwinds, tiredness and sweat.
Most of our customers are ageing baby boomers who want to have the cycling experience they had as a kid, says Pedegos Don DiCostanza.
CEO Craig Anderson says: We want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and encourage a healthy lifestyle.
Accell has great hopes for e-bikes in North America, Curries Larry Pizzi says.
While baby boomers are still very important, were finding that a lot of younger people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars.
Jordan Axani, a 28-year-old Toronto charity founder, arrived back in Canada with Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher and said the pair had a brother-sister-like relationship.
Axani had made headlines in 2014 because he offered an air ticket to any Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher.
He had booked a three-week vacation with his girlfriend but they split up and he was unable to change the name on the flight tickets.
And our feelings are entirely mutual.
There was a certain amount of stumbling around as the pair got to know each other about the dos and donts of travelling together.
At the end of it, wed developed a really great rhythm  one second, we had really funny inside jokes and, the next second, we knew when the other person needed space.
Although the pair did not fall in love, Axani said the trip, which included Milan, Venice, Vienna, Prague, Khao Lak (in Thailand) and Hong Kong, was fantastic.
In terms of his love life, Axani said he was not looking for his next Elizabeth Gallagher yet.
Im not looking for anything but life happens and well see, he said.
A companion had died at sea several months before, he said.
His condition isnt good, but hes getting better, said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on Ebon Island, one of the Marshall Islands.
The man said his name was Jos Ivan and that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands.
The boat looks like it has been in the water for a long time, Fjeldstad told reporters.
Officials at the ministry said that they were waiting for more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital.
Hes staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him, said Fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but did not appear to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk.
Fraser Christian, who teaches maritime survival courses, said the mans story, if true, would be remarkable but not unique.
It was possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, since they are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it.
Christian advises people who are forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes  lots of fluid  then move on to the blood.
On the dry grass not far from the India Gate monument at the centre of Delhi, they stretch, breathe and meditate.
Singh, a 42-year-old salesman, and his friends are not alone.
All across India, in the overcrowded cities, on whatever green space is left, you can see similar scenes.
Encouraging Indians, and others, to stretch has become a focus for Modi, who led his Bharatiya Janata Party to a landslide election victory in 2014.
In May 2015, schools were told to make sure students attended yoga events at the same time as the big demonstration in Delhi, even though it is on a Sunday.
Air India, the national airline, has also said it will introduce yoga for trainee pilots.
Modi, an ascetic who is a vegetarian and an enthusiastic yoga practitioner, suggested an international yoga day when he was speaking to the United Nations on a visit to New York in 2014.
Modi said that yoga is an invaluable gift of Indias ancient tradition.
He said that it encourages unity of mind and body, thought and action, harmony between man and nature, and a holistic approach to health and wellbeing.
A court in California ruled that: The practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts but yoga classes as taught in the [San Diego] district are not religious, mystical or spiritual.
In ancient India, yoga was part of daily life, both the physical and the mental aspects.
It is the same with yoga  yoga is for everybody.
Basfords intricately drawn pictures of flora and fauna in Secret Garden have sold 1.4 million copies worldwide, with the next book, Enchanted Forest, selling just under 226,000 copies already.
They have fans like Zooey Deschanel, who shared a link about the book with her Facebook followers, and the South Korean pop star Kim Ki- Bum, who posted an image on Instagram for his 1.6 million followers.
The last few weeks have been utter madness, but fantastic madness, said Eleanor Blatherwick, head of sales and marketing at the books publisher, small British press Laurence King.
And it is not just Basford who is benefitting from the adults who just want something to colour in.
In the UK, Richard Merritts Art Therapy Colouring Book is in fourth place on Amazons bestseller lists, Millie Marottas Animal Kingdom  detailed pictures of animals to colour  is in seventh and a mindfulness colouring book is in ninth.
Basfords books are in second and eighth place  thats half of Amazon.co.uks top ten filled up by colouring books for adults.
At independent UK publisher Michael OMara, which has sold almost 340,000 adult colouring books, Head of Publicity, Marketing and Online, Ana McLaughlin, says the craze is due to the way the category is now sold as a way to relax.
The first one we did was in 2012, Creative Colouring for Grown-Ups.
It sold well but it was in 2014 that it all really mushroomed with Art Therapy.
It became really popular  selling it as an anti-stress book gave people permission to enjoy something they might have felt was quite childish, she said.
I think it is really relaxing to unplug, said Basford.
I drew a kids book and I told them I would like to do one for grown-ups.
He owned a gold and silver Rolex and lots of expensive cars.
When police searched his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: 100, 200 and 500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands.
Gaos gang is accused of laundering up to 300m a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks.
Small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method that tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons prefer to use.
The sum of 1m in 500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag.
Other countries have limited their own high-denomination notes due to links to organized crime  Canada got rid of its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers.
Peter Sands, the former head of Standard Chartered Bank, said we should get rid of high-denomination notes, including the 500, the $100, the 1,000 Swiss Franc note and the 50.
At a conference on terrorist financing in London, the Head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, asked the European Central Bank to look at whether it should continue to produce these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to provide money for illegal activities.
According to Europol, the purple 500 note makes up 30% of the value of all the euro notes, although most people have never seen one.
In Germany and Austria, more than half of all transactions are still made with paper money and coins.
Luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual GDP in banknotes in 2013 alone.
A small cultural centre in the capital city, Havana, has suddenly become a rare source of free wi-fi.
The internationally known Cuban artist Kcho is providing the service.
But, in a country where only about 5% of the population has unrestricted access to the internet, a facility that is both free of charge and free of restrictions is being welcomed.
The chance to click on international news websites, communicate with friends and family overseas and use sites like Facebook and Twitter has created a lot of excitement.
Another estimate, that a quarter of Cubans have access to the internet  still one of the lowest rates in the Western Hemisphere  in fact measures residents who use a restricted domestic intranet that only features certain websites and has limited email.
Its only possible if you are determined and if you absorb the costs, Kcho told the Associated Press.
He became famous internationally for his painting, sculpture and drawings after winning the grand prize at a prominent art biennial in South Korea.
Born on one of Cubas islands, he is known for contemporary art with rustic, seaside and patriotic themes and imagery.
Kcho is believed to be paying $900 a month to provide the free wi-fi.
A 2014 report found average internet connectivity speeds to be around 10.5mbps in the US and 23.6mbps in world-leading South Korea.
With dozens of users at one time, the signal strength of Kchos wi-fi is diluted.
One user said he sometimes visits in the middle of the night, when nobody else is around, and finds it to be unbelievably fast. 
Until the end, David Bowie, who has died of cancer, was still full of surprises.
His latest album, Blackstar, appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 January 2016 and proved that he hadnt lost his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging, disturbing music.
In 1953, the family moved to Kent, where David showed talent for singing and playing the recorder.
It was clear that Davids talents and ambition meant that he should go solo.
David took the name Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees.
In July 1969, Bowie released Space Oddity, the song that would give him his first commercial breakthrough.
The albums themes included immortality, insanity, murder and mysticism, which showed that Bowie was a songwriter who was thinking outside of pops usual boundaries.
He had his first UK number 1 album with Aladdin Sane (1973), which included the hit singles The Jean Genie and Drive-in Saturday.
But Bowie was already planning his next career moves.
Bowies relationship with his wife had been suffering under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in 1980.
This was a year of further creative triumph, bringing a fine album, Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and its chart-topping single, Ashes to Ashes, followed by a period playing the title role in The Elephant Man on the Broadway stage.
He achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with Queen, Under Pressure, and became increasingly involved with different media.
Lets Dance turned Bowie into a crowd-friendly global rock star, with the album and its singles Lets Dance, China Girl and Modern Love all becoming huge international hits.
In addition, that year, he teamed up with Mick Jagger to record the fundraising single Dancing in the Street, which quickly went to number 1.
For the album Black Tie White Noise (1993), he included elements of soul, electronica and hip hop.
It topped the UK album chart and gave him a top 10 single, Jump They Say.
It included the single Where Are We Now?, which gave him his first UK top 10 hit since 1993.
The album went to the top of the charts in Britain and around the world.
In 2014, Bowie was given the Brit Award for Best British Male, making him the oldest person to get the award.
Each year for the next 100 years, an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114, when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed.
Each author  their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and Paterson, while she is alive  will travel to the spot in the forest high above Oslo, where they will hand over their manuscripts in a short ceremony.
Id look such a fool if they opened it in 2114 and it wasnt any good.
Its ending, Rolled round in earths diurnal course / With rocks, and stones, and trees, felt appropriate in this small section of forest, which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into Future Librarys manuscripts.
Yet, how low-key and understated, to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever congratulate you for and say: Nice one or God, I loved the bit where she did that and he did this ... Mitchell wrote in a piece for the Future Library.
Watched over by a panel of experts until it is finally printed, it is now, says the novelist, as gone from me as a coin dropped in a river. 
Lima has black vultures.
In many ways, with their wrinkly heads and beady eyes, they remind Lima residents of the side of their city they would rather ignore: the poverty and filth.
Environmental authorities are kitting the birds out with GoPro video cameras and GPS trackers  the birds have a new mission in the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping.
Fitted with his tracker, he is set free above the city, where he identifies secret or hidden dumps and records the GPS coordinates on a live map.
His trainer at Limas Huachipa Zoo, Alfredo Correa, is full of admiration.
They can eat dead animals because their bodies protect them from viruses and bacteria, he says.
With just four landfills in a city of nearly ten million inhabitants, there are many illegal dumps.
The waste contaminates Limas main water source, the Rimac river, as well as the Chillon and Lurin rivers, which flow into the Bay of Lima.
Many residents just dont pay.
It also means nobody is necessarily going to clean up where the vultures identify illegal trash.
The project aims to encourage residents to be vultures on the ground: to report fly-tipping, cut back on their own waste and recycle.
Some residents are responding, posting photos of illegal dumps on the Twitter feed and Facebook page.     
New regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic, not in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, which is what happens at the moment.
Pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are believed to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the UK alone.
The current New European Drive Cycle laboratory test for measuring emissions is a quarter of a century old.
Studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed  car makers fix the results by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at very high temperatures.
The Commission wants to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving, said Lucia Caudet, a Commission spokesperson.
One key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens each year is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing much more pollution on the road, said Greg Archer, the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment.
European Union (EU) states should now support the Commissions proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too strict.
According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg per kilometre standard, with some types of cars 22 times above the recommended limit.
Only one car out of 16 met the 80mg target.
Real Driving Emissions (RDE) is a totally new regulation that will force significant changes to cars, said Cara McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA).
ACEAs draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and delayed the regulations introduction until 2020.
By 2017, the first realworld CO2 emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest.
That evening, the woman was tickling Dustys tummy and it just looked so inviting.
Just after I got into the water, Dusty left the woman she was with and went crazy  I found out afterwards that shes very territorial when she is with somebody.
Her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, I thought it was a display but, then, I realized she was angry.
Then, another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon.
I was in hospital for five days and off work for five months with limited mobility and pain.
I had therapy, osteopathy and massage, and am building up my own osteopathy practice now.
If you see a fierce animal coming towards you with its teeth bared, its scary, but dolphins have this lovely, wide smile.
After the man pulled me out of the water, Dusty swam away but, then, she came back and was looking at me.
Our eyes met and I felt there was complete remorse in her.
We have all become familiar with wildlife emergencies such as the threatened extinction of the tiger in India, the orangutan in Indonesia and the panda.
But, now, scientists fear the real impact of declining wildlife could be closer to home  they believe the threat to creatures such as ladybirds is a much greater danger to biodiversity.
Climate change, falling numbers of animals, rising numbers of humans and the rapid rate of species extinction mean more and more scientists now believe that we are in the Anthropocene age  the geological age of extinction when humans finally dominate the ecosystems.
The report showed the number of vertebrates had declined by 52% over four decades.
But its the creatures that provide the most ecosystem services that are getting many scientists really worried.
Three quarters of the worlds food production is thought to depend on bees and other pollinators.
The really interesting thing about this work is that we are learning that its not just about the numbers of species going extinct, but the actual numbers in a population; thats the beginning of a fundamental shift in our understanding, he says.
The blame, most people agree, is unsustainable human consumption damaging ecosystems, creating climate change and destroying habitats at a far faster rate than previously thought.
Humans, said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013, are a plague on earth, but the WWF claims there is still time to stop the decline.
We all  politicians, business and people  have an interest, and a responsibility, to protect what we all value: a healthy future for people and nature.
The Canadian tennis player Frank Dancevic slammed Australian Open organizers for forcing players to compete in inhumane conditions.
He also said the heat had caused him to hallucinate: I was dizzy from the middle of the fi rst set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, Wow, Snoopy  thats weird.
Ive played fi ve set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat stroke, its not normal.
Having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that its too hot to play; I, personally, dont think its fair and I know a lot of players dont think its fair.
I know when I went out before the match, the conditions at 2.303pm were very, very tough.
The defending champion Victoria Azarenka said, It felt pretty hot, like youre dancing in a frying pan or something like that.
Under a change to the rules for 2014, the decision on whether to stop matches at the tournament is now at the discretion of the tournament director, Wayne McKewen.
Organizers said temperatures peaked at 42.2C in the early evening on Tuesday and conditions had never reached the point where the matches would be stopped.
While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue, McKewen said in a statement.
A ball boy had earlier required medical attention after collapsing during Milos Raonics 76, 61, 46, 62 victory over Daniel Gimeno-Traver on the equally exposed court eight and the tournament started only allowing the ball boys to work for 45 minute periods.
Chinas Peng Shuai also said the heat had made her cramp up and vomit, and she had to be helped from the court after her 75, 46, 63 defeat to Japans Kurumi Nara.
The day began with more police dawn raids on the Baur Au Lac hotel in Zurich and ended with 16 football officials being charged with corruption in the US, including five current or former members of FIFAs executive committee.
They included the former Brazilian federation chief Ricardo Teixeira and his successor, Marco Polo Del Nero, who recently stepped down from the FIFA executive committee.
They were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other offences by the US Department of Justice as it gave details of a series of kickback schemes in a new 240-page indictment.
The betrayal of trust here is outrageous, the US Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, said.
The scale of corruption is completely unacceptable.
Hawit only succeeded Jeffrey Webb in May 2015, after Webb was arrested as part of the US operation that threw FIFA into crisis and led to the downfall of Sepp Blatter.
Webbs predecessor, the controversial Jack Warner, was also arrested in May.
The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said of the latest arrests: They are in custody pending their extradition.
The message from this announcement should be clear to every individual who remains in the shadows, hoping to evade our investigation: you will not escape our focus, said Lynch.
Teixeira, the former son-in-law of the FIFA ex-president Joo Havelange, was charged alongside Del Nero and his predecessor Jos Maria Marin, who was charged in May.
He was then provisionally suspended together with the UEFA President, Michel Platini, over an alleged 1.3m payment to the Frenchman.
Both men face possible life bans when their case is heard by the FIFA ethics committee in December if they are found guilty.
Among those also charged on Thursday were Rafael Salguero, a Guatemalan who left the executive committee in May; the former South American confederation Secretary General, Eduardo Deluca; the former Peruvian football federation president, Manuel Burga; and Bolivias football president, Carlos Chaves, already jailed in his own country.
Lynch said: The Department of Justice is committed to ending the rampant corruption we have described in the leadership of international football  not only because of the scale of the schemes alleged earlier and today or the breadth of the operation required to sustain such corruption, but also because of the insult to international principles that this behaviour represents.
Appearing for the first time before the media since taking the role in September 2015, when Blatter was suspended, Hayatou responded in a similar way to his predecessor when he claimed the current crisis was the fault of a few bad individuals.
A fifth of young adults are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and the same proportion are not paying a penny towards their keep.
While many around the country contributed financially, it found that 20% were paying nothing at all.
Young adults are squeezed by low wages and high rents, while those who want to buy a property are finding the monthly cost of renting is preventing them from saving enough to get on the housing ladder.
I dont really want to move out to rent as its more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage so its a vicious circle.
He does not want to share with strangers so his options are limited.
At home, he pays a nominal rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of his earnings from his job.
Sue Green, of Saga, a business that sells insurance to people over 50, said the majority of parents may not have planned to have their children living with them in their 20s or 30s.
Most will be more than happy to have them in the family home rent-free because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner, she said.
Angus Hanton, of the Intergenerational Foundation thinktank, said older generations were the architects of the housing crisis and children should not be blamed for staying at home.
The under-30s have suffered a reduction in average incomes of about 20% since the 2008 downturn.
Rents and car insurance have never been so high and mortgage lending rules are now stricter for the young but not for older buy-to-let investors, who squeeze out the young, he said.
Many jobs on offer  zero-hour and short-term contracts  are turning younger workers into second-class citizens.
Rather than blaming the young, we should help them so they can afford to build lives of their own.
But renting a one-bedroom flat would cost more than 420 a month not including bills, which would use a lot of her earnings.
They want me to try to save up and I contribute in other ways  I buy food and I do things around the house.
She previously coached Benficas male youth teams, the Qatar womens team and, more recently, the Iranian womens national side, which she left in September 2013.
Costa, 36, was appointed on a two-year contract by the president of Clermont Foot 63, Claude Michy, who is a champion at grabbing the headlines for his club.
She added: For the time being, I see too many men, even in the womens game, who are working despite not having the same expertise as women, who, by contrast, are not working.
After doing work experience at Chelsea during her compatriot Jos Mourinhos first time as manager of the club between 2004 and 2007, she was described as Mourinho in a skirt.
One of the biggest surprises was the discovery that there are mountains in the Kuiper belt, the solar systems mysterious third zone where Pluto is, with about 100,000 smaller icy objects.
John Spencer, a mission scientist, said the mountains appear to be around 3,000 metres high and several hundred miles across.
Weve brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus, said Dwayne Brown, NASA spokesman, as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be shown.
The images have already produced some surprises.
Scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin cover of exotic ices, methane and nitrogen.
The mountains on Pluto probably formed no more than 100m years ago  extremely recently in the 4.56bn-year-old solar system.
This suggests the region, which covers about 1% of Plutos surface, may still be geologically active.
The images are so detailed that, if the craft were flying over London, we would be able to see the runways at Heathrow airport.
The distance to Pluto  5bn km  means it takes New Horizons hours to send back a picture and it will take 16 months to send back all the data.
The team also announced that the heart-shaped feature visible on Pluto will now be known as the Tombaugh Regio, after Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930.
The image also shows a dramatic canyon about 7 to 9km deep.
Cathy Olkin, a mission scientist, said: Charon just blew our socks off when we saw the new image today.
Then, its plutonium power source will run out and it will drift outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space.
We asked five people who do some unusual jobs how much they are paid, what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work.
Dog-food taster The job: Tasting dog food to make sure it meets a top brands quality standards  What it involves: Opening sample tins of each batch of dog (or cat) food, smelling it and eating it.
Although dogs sense of taste is different from ours, tasting is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way, says Philip Wells, the chief taster for Lilys Kitchen pet food.
Wells finds it rewarding that a project he has worked on will help pets to become happier and healthier.
Hygiene technician The job: Disinfecting areas that might have been exposed to bio-hazardous situations  What it involves: Cleaning up crime scenes, road accidents and suicides.
Clearing houses full of rubbish, rats and excrement  among other things.
You get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard, he says.
Job satisfaction: Lewis finds the variety of tasks exciting.
One day, Im cleaning up after a dead body; another day, Im in a prison cell or high in the air being lowered down into a silo to clean it.
Biogas engineer The job: Setting up biogas plants in developing countries  What it involves: Linking a system  which can be filled with human excrement, animal dung and other waste products  to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting.
Typical salary: An entry-level salary is around 10,000, while a typical salary for a chief technical officer is 30,000.
Unsurprisingly, the anaerobic digestion (the process that takes place when bacteria eat the waste and produce methane) smells like rotten eggs.
Eel ecologist The job: Conserving the critically endangered European eel  What it involves: To monitor the size of the endangered eels, ecologists walk into the Thames and other London rivers full of eels, sometimes up to their armpits, and reach into a net filled with up to 20 adult eels to take one out with their bare hands.
Its difficult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass.
Worst part of the job: Eels are really tricky creatures to work with says Mowat.
But, for Mowat, the worst part of the job is definitely not handling the eels  he believes baby eels (known as elvers) are as cute as pandas: The worst thing about the job is regularly learning how much damage we are doing to the environment.
Eels are beautiful creatures and working with eels doesnt just benefit the eel  it helps rivers and coastal areas.
That is something worth doing.
Shopping channel presenter The job: Selling and demonstrating a wide range of products on live TV  What it involves: Presenting hours and hours of monotonous TV, while, at the same time, demonstrating the products and appearing to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about everything that youre selling.
An experienced presenter like me generally has to work weekends, bank holidays and very late evenings, plus, occasionally, a 5am shift.
The four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were included.
The new elements, all highly radioactive, complete seventh row of the periodic table and mean that science textbooks around the world are now out of date.
The US-based International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the global organization that controls chemical names, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 December, 2015 after examining studies dating back to 2004.
The scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the Latin-based temporary names  ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium  which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118.
The organization gave credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the Russians and Americans, to a team of scientists from the RIKEN Institute in Japan.
When elements 114 and 116 were given formal names in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively, after the Flerov Lab at Dubnas Joint Institute of Research and the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the US, where the elements were discovered.
Jan Reedijk of IUPAC, said: The chemistry community is eager to see the table finally completed down to the seventh row.
The Japanese team is considering three names for ununtrium: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, where the element was found.
If we understand it better, hopefully we can improve how we deal with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world.
Along with new names, the scientists must suggest two-letter symbols for the elements.
In 1996, the symbol Cp was suggested for copernicium, or element 112, but it was changed to Cn when scientists complained that Cp referred to another substance.
To discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for radioactive decays that should come from the new elements.
The fourth element, ununoctium, may be a gas, like other elements, helium, neon and argon.
The 140,000 ticketholders are also being asked to bring reusable bottles that they can fill at 400 drinking-water taps across the site.
Environmentalists say that there is currently 150 million tonnes of plastic waste around the planet and oceans, poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife.
We do everything we can, but the litter of 140,000 people is a challenge.
Smith said that, instead of buying bottled water, festival-goers should take advantage of the water on tap, which comes from huge underground reservoirs.
Everyone knows the British love tea but consumption has more than halved since the 1970s, falling from 68g of tea per person per week to only 25g.
There has also been a dramatic shift from white to brown bread but the figures suggest the amount of bread people are eating has fallen from 25 to 15 slices a week over the past four decades.
The consumption of baked beans has dropped by a fifth despite a rise in other types of convenience food, particularly Italian dishes.
Some trends suggest that British people are becoming more careful about what they put on their plates, with the average consumption of fruit increasing by 50% since 1974.
Britons are also spending a smaller proportion of their salaries on food today  11%, compared with 24% in 1974.
Shoppers care more about where their food comes from than ever before, the internet has brought quality food to our doors at the click of a button, fashionable restaurants are showcasing the latest trends and exciting global cuisines are now as common as fish and chips.
By studying this data, we can look beyond what, where or how previous generations were eating and pinpoint the moments that changed our habits forever.
From local food maps and school projects to predicting new food trends, I look forward to seeing how this data can be used to learn more about our past and grow our world-leading food and farming industry in the future.   
If we want to preserve them, we need to make sure that the digital objects we create today can still be viewed far into the future, he added.
His warning highlights an irony at the heart of modern technology, where music, photos, letters and other documents are digitized in order to ensure their long-term survival.
But, while researchers are making progress in storing digital files for centuries, the programs and hardware needed to read the files are continually falling out of use.
We are throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realizing it.
But what we dont understand is that, unless we take other steps, those digital versions may not be any better, and may even be worse, than the artefacts that we digitized, Cerf says.
To study todays culture, future scholars would be faced with PDFs, Word documents and hundreds of other file types that can only be interpreted with special software and sometimes hardware, too.
In 2005, American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote Team of Rivals: the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln.
In todays world, those letters would be emails and the chances of finding them will be incredibly small one hundred years from now, said Cerf.
Weve been surprised by what weve learned about an earlier civilizations from objects that have been preserved only by chance, he said.
Digital snapshots of computer hard drives are taken while they run different software programs.
The result is a computer that can read defunct files.
It could be even more difficult to obtain the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies.
A car with a top speed of 25mph, two seats and no pedals or steering wheel might not make much of an impression at a motor show.
But Google, in the US, sent a shock through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car.
Instead, it has a smartphone app that calls it and tells it the destination, and a single STOP button between the two front-facing seats in case the passengers need to override the computer.
The car, in fact, does all the tasks of navigation, steering, acceleration and braking.
The companys co-founder, Sergey Brin, told a conference in California that the vehicle was still in the prototype stage but that the project was about changing the world for people who do not have good transportation today.
The cars, which have been built specially by an unnamed company in Detroit, will be used to find out how best to make driverless vehicles work.
One challenge is creating high-definition scans of the roads and surroundings before the cars can drive along them because they cannot collect and process enough information in real time.
Google says it is interested in licensing the technology to traditional vehicle manufacturers once it has been refined.
But the idea of driverless cars replacing humandriven taxis has been the cause of some alarm.
But Chris Urmson, director of the self-driving car project at Google, said that the new prototypes dispensed with the steering wheel and brakes because a human passenger might not be able to take over in an emergency, and that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button.
And, thats an important step towards improving road safety and improving mobility for millions of people.
So far, the Google versions of the self-driving cars have driven 700,000 miles without an accident caused by the computer.
The company says that thousands of people die each year on the roads and that about 80% of crashes are caused by human error.     
The atmosphere at the beginning of the final series of Downton Abbey is one of melancholy and changing times.
Now, it is loved by millions of other people.
But, a restoration project of tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showing the work of the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Sir Charles Barry, who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842.
Lord Carnarvon said then: It was just after the banking crisis and we were worried.
Visitor numbers doubled, to 1,200 a day, as Downton Abbey, written by Julian Fellowes, was shown around the world after becoming a hit in the UK in 2010 and, then, in the US.
Peter Fincham, ITVs director of television, remembers the moment when Highclere was booked.
VisitBritain estimates that nearly 30% of foreign visitors, or nearly nine million people, visit castles and historic houses.
VisitBritains director, Patricia Yates, said: The links between tourism, films and TV are strong.
It is a fantasy world, based in a particular time in history.
Its the first TV period drama that has really become part of popular culture.
Lady Carnarvon says that the long-term future of Highclere is not necessarily secure.
In the past, an estate and house supported the family and their lifestyle but, today, it is quite the reverse: the challenge is how Geordie and I can support Highclere.
In my new role, day shifts were spent on the streets in political rallies and nights were spent alone in the offi ce, coordinating the news from areas of fi ghting in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and the rest of Central America.
But, I also had to report on occasional disasters: fi res, fl oods and explosions at firework factories.
Once, when I meant to call the police, I got a Mexican grandmother out of bed at 2am because I had misunderstood a number and dialled a wrong digit.
Even worse, there were too many victims in my stories  almost 83 dead in a fi re at 6pm turned out to be as few as 38 by 7pm; 12 people injured in a coach crash soon became two and so it went on.
I dont know what training you have had, an editor shouted, but has no one ever told you a death toll cant go down?!
It may be because of different numbering systems.
In my case, I have always found languages quite easy, apart from the numbers.
With no senior English-speaking reporter in the offi ce, I had to try to reach the consulate by phone.
I didnt persuade him to put away his gun  but my reputation as a reporter rose overnight. 
George W Bush, Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Hawking have done it.
It was an unfortunate coincidence that 31 August to 5 September was World Water Week, with international delegates arriving in Stockholm to discuss the planets water crisis.
The charity WaterAid is asking people to use recycled water from bathtubs or garden butts or to use sea water.
Former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, an animal-rights activist, wrote an open letter to the ALS Association, saying she could not support its record on animal experimentation.
Actor Verne Troyer used milk, again saying it was for environmental reasons.
And the challenge has been blamed for causing a water shortage on the Scottish island of Colonsay.
In Australia, a TV anchorman apologized over his strong no, thanks response to being nominated.
Another criticism has been that small charities wont be able to cope with the extra money, but the MND Association rejected this.
We fund world-class research into the causes of the disease to find a treatment or cure.
We provide care and support for 3,500 people and they need it because this is such a rapidly progressing disease and its expensive to manage.
But, for many people with a connection to the disease, the awareness that the challenge has created is as valuable as the money.
In Iceland, you can be called Aagot, Arney or sfrur; Baldey, Bebba or Br.
Dgg, Dimmbl, Etna and Eybjrt are fine and so are Frigg, Glds, Hrn and Ingunn.
Jrlaug is OK, as are Obba, Sigurflj, rana and Vagna.
The whole situation, said Tristan Cardew, is really rather silly.
With his Icelandic wife, Kristin, Cardew is appealing against a decision by the National Registry in the capital Reykjavik not to renew their ten-year-old daughter Harriets passport because it does not recognize her first name.
The situation meant the family, from Kpavogur, risked missing their holiday in France until they applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport, which should now allow them to leave.
Names are important in Iceland, a country of only 320,000 people, whose phone book lists subscribers by their first name for the very sensible reason that most Icelandic surnames simply record the fact that you are your fathers (or mothers) son or daughter.
Jn Einarssons children, for example, might be lafur Jnsson and Sigrur Jnsdttir.
The law says that the names of children born in Iceland must  unless both parents are foreign  be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth.
For the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half under a 1996 law aimed mainly at preserving the Icelandic language.
Among its requirements are that given names must be capable of having Icelandic grammatical endings, may not conflict with the linguistic structure of Iceland and should be written in accordance with the ordinary rules of Icelandic spelling.
The countrys naming laws have been criticized in recent years: in 2013, Blr  Light Breeze  Bjarkardttir Rnarsdottir won the right to be officially known by her given name, as opposed to Girl, when a court ruled that denying her was a violation of the Icelandic constitution.

However, its effects can be reduced by keeping food bland for 24 hours before travel, drinking plenty of fluids and living on your destination time from the moment you reach the aircraft.
If an airliner with an airspeed of 550mph enters a jet stream, the result can be that it flies at 800mph, faster than the speed of sound.
However, its so minimal that crossing the Atlantic weekly for 40 years would only move you 1/1,000th of a second into the future.
I cant hear my food Airline food is often said to be bland and tasteless.
Needle in a haystack With modern technology, it seems strange that Malaysian flight MH370 could disappear  but finding a missing aircraft is a needle-in-a-haystack problem.
The survey, based on interviews with 150 wealthy individuals, comes at a time when there are signs of returning business confidence in the worlds biggest democracy.
Cities are mushrooming, the middle class population growing, opportunities have increased many times over and the political environment has improved greatly in recent months, says Murali Balaraman, a co-author.
A booming luxury market is serving the new rich.
They really want to show or talk about their wealth in a really subtle way and buying luxury goods is a nice way to do it, Balaraman said.
Abhay Gupta, the CEO of brand consultancy Luxury Connect, said the market for luxury goods and experiences would only get bigger.
Mercedes saw a 47% growth in sales in India in 2013.
However, the most popular investments are still real estate  mainly within India  and jewellery.
The 27-storey tower, complete with helicopter pads, indoor cinemas and a staff of more than 600, is worth $1bn.
The three-day wedding of the niece of Lakshmi Mittal, the UK-based steel tycoon who is worth $16bn, was reported to have cost $80m.
One buyer ordered nine cases of Japanese whisky costing over $750 a bottle for a wedding reception.
Another big spender bought identical pairs of Louis Vuitton bags, then cut up half of them to make clothes that would match her accessories.
Co-author Balaraman says that growth in the number of rich people would not result in social tensions because a wide gap in incomes and wealth is an accepted norm in India.
An octopus has escaped from the National Aquarium in New Zealand by leaving its tank, sliding down a 50-metre drainpipe and disappearing into the sea.
Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky climbed to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor of the aquarium.
Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: Octopuses are famous for their ability to escape.
I dont think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, because octopuses are solitary creatures.
He wanted to know what was happening on the outside.
One theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor  a journey of three or four metres  and, then, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea.
The drainpipe was 50 metres long and led to the waters of Hawkes Bay, on the east coast of New Zealands North Island.
It is also possible that Inky escaped by squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain.
Reiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky was not stolen.
I understand octopus behaviour very well, he said.
I have seen octopuses on boats escape through bilge pumps.
Because octopuses have no bones, they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and can squeeze through gaps the size of coins.
They are also extremely intelligent and can use tools.
Inky was brought to the National Aquarium several years ago by a local fisherman who found him caught in a fishing pot.
He was very friendly and a popular attraction here.
OK, so regretting making Flappy Bird isnt quite the same as regretting making a rifl e, but Nguyen is just the latest inventor who wished he hadnt created a monster.
The labradoodle The labradoodle isnt a monster  its adorable.
But whats monstrous is the way crossbreed dogs have been sold since the labradoodles inventor, Wally Conron, fi rst created the breed in the 1980s.
What he didnt expect was that the labradoodle  and other types of poodle-cross dogs, many of which have health problems  would become so popular.
If my rifl e killed people, does that mean that I, Mikhail Kalashnikov, 93 years of age, the son of a poor farmer, Christian and Orthodox by faith, am responsible for peoples deaths, even if they were enemies?
Electronic tagging The electronic tag was originally made in the 1960s as a way of tracking former prisoners attendance at school and work, and rewarding them for good behaviour.

JMW Turner, one of Britains greatest painters, will appear on the new 20 note, after a nationwide vote.
It will be the first time an artist has appeared on a British banknote, after the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, asked the public to choose a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved to be on the banknote.
Turner, who is famous for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public.
The final five  Barbara Hepworth, Charlie Chaplin, Josiah Wedgwood, William Hogarth and Turner  were chosen because of their unquestioned contribution to both the visual arts and British society, as well as their enduring influence.
In 1786, when he was sent to Margate, his love of painting and drawing the north-east Kent coast began.
He returned to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours.
Turner was a very prolific artist  he produced more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours in his lifetime.
His life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by Mike Leigh, with Timothy Spall as the artist.
Victoria Pomery, the director of Turner Contemporary, said: The decision to celebrate JMW Turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of British art, is extraordinary.
While many British workers see a two-week summer holiday as their right, workers in Japan think that a four-night vacation in Hawaii is complete self-indulgence.
Japans low birth rate and population decline are partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to start families.
About 22% of Japanese people work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of US workers and 11% in France and Germany, according to data from the Japanese government.
Erika Sekiguchi spends 14 hours a day at work and gives up many of her paid holidays.
The 36-year-old trading company employee used eight of her 20 days of paid vacation in 2014, six of which were sick leave.
Yuu Wakebe, a health ministry official overseeing policy on working hours, admits that he does 100 hours of overtime a month.
That fear of being ostracized at work is the reason for a rise in stress-related illness, premature death and suicide.
According to official data, about 200 people die every year from heart attacks, strokes and other karoshi events because of tough work schedules.
It will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might be alone over the holiday.
The department store has spent 7m on a campaign that ranges from the TV ad to a smartphone game and merchandise, including glow-in-the-dark pyjamas, as well as making areas that look like the surface of the moon in 11 of their stores.
After two years of successful ads with cuddly animals  a bear and hare, then a penguin  this time, the store is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl, Lily, who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope.
The determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow, before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons, which finally allows them to make contact.
The ads message is: Show someone theyre loved this Christmas, which echoes Age UKs own campaign: No one should have no one at Christmas.
Rachel Swift, head of marketing at John Lewis, said that people talk about the charity at this time of year and the ad makes you think about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody.
The campaign features the Oasis track Half the World Away reinterpreted by Norwegian artist Aurora.
A full moon will fall on Christmas Day 2015  a complete coincidence, according to Swift.
It had drummed up 22m views on YouTube by the first week of January  more than the 16.6m views of Sainsburys ad with First World War soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate, the UKs second most popular ad of 2014.
Swift said that, despite the hype, John Lewis had kept the same strategy for the last five years.
Sarah Vizard, news editor of trade journal Marketing Week, said John Lewis appeared to have simplified efforts this time, with a lower-key presence in stores despite a growing number of competitors.
This campaign is another great way of communicating that in a way that customers can relate to.
Before her highly anticipated series of concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, Bush released a statement asking her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs.
With her love of theatrics and opulent costumes, Bushs keenness to stop fans uploading footage to YouTube could also be an attempt to keep the show a surprise for the thousands of fans who have bought tickets for the 22 dates she is playing.
You cant even sing because youre too busy filming, Beyonc told him.
Recently, Dutch football fans at PSV Eindhoven protested against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium, holding up banners with messages like No wi-fi.
Support the team, You can sit at home, and Stand united, while Manchester United have also told fans to leave their large electronic devices at home.
Jarvis Cocker has also criticized fans with phones in the audience  he says they drive him insane at concerts, adding: It seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen thats smaller than a cigarette packet.
Even in the world of classical music, one of the worlds leading pianists surprised concertgoers in June 2013 when he stormed off stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone.
Krystian Zimerman returned moments later and said: The destruction of music because of YouTube is enormous.
But Sam Watt of Vyclone, a phone app that encourages audiences to film at concerts and then brings together the footage to create a crowd-sourced video of the event, said that filming at concerts enhanced the experience.
Fans filming is now part of the concert experience  that is a just a fact  so we take the footage that people are filming at concerts and then it comes back to them mixed together with everybody else who was filming.
Our thinking is that filming at concerts adds to the experience, rather than taking away from it and I think, if Kate Bush came round for a cup of tea, we could have a really interesting discussion about this, he added.
But thats exactly what Kiruna, an Arctic town in northern Sweden, has to do  to avoid being swallowed up into the earth.
The town is here because of the mine, says Deputy Mayor Niklas Siren.
Otherwise, no one would have built a city here.
In 2004, the mining company told the town that its days were numbered: digging its shafts towards the city at an angle of 60 degrees, subsidence would soon lead to buildings cracking and collapsing.
After years of dithering, the city finally has a plan for how it will proceed.
Kirunas red wooden church, built in 1912 and once voted Swedens most beautiful building, will take pride of place in a new park, and the bell tower will stand once again above the town hall.
Its things like that  the hospital where your first child was born, for example  that are important to people and all thats going to disappear.
Called the most democratic move in history, the project will get 320m from the mining company for building new facilities, including a high school, fire station, community centre, library and swimming hall.
People are used to very low rents and very high incomes but, in future, this will have to change says Lindstedt.
LK has agreed to compensate residents to the value of their homes plus 25% but many locals say this is not enough to afford a new-build house.
But it is a vision that many of the existing residents will probably not be able to afford.   
The Danish toy firms sales rose across Europe, the Americas and Asia as children bought products linked to the film.
The film, released in February 2014, took more than $250m in the US and 31m in the UK by the first weekend in April.
Lego, based in the small town of Billund, started producing its plastic bricks in 1949 and became a popular and well-known childrens toy around the world by the 1970s.
The company opened its first factory in China in April and opened an office in Shanghai to start expansion into the worlds second-biggest economy.   
And research at the University of Chicago has found that loneliness is twice as bad for older peoples health as obesity and almost as great a cause of death as poverty.
This is shocking but such studies do not examine the loneliness epidemic among younger adults.
In 2010, the Mental Health Foundation found that loneliness was a greater concern among young people than among the elderly.
Loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly and there are day centres and charities to help them, says Sam Challis, of the mental health charity Mind, but, when young people reach 21, theyre too old for youth services.
This is problematic because of the close relationship between loneliness and mental health  it is linked to increased stress, depression, paranoia, anxiety, addiction and it is a known cause of suicide.
People present an idealized version of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like those we see in the media, says Challis.
Comparing the perfect lives of our friends with our own lives can lead us to withdraw socially.
Indeed, a study of social media at the University of Michigan in 2013 found that using technology to help you meet new people can be beneficial.
One in four men who call the emotional support charity Samaritans mention loneliness or isolation and Get Connected is a free confidential helpline for young people, where they can get help with emotional and mental health problems often linked to loneliness.
More openness with his employer and colleagues made his return to work easier.
Office chit-chat may seem like a waste of time but it helps to protect us from the emotional and psychological effects of work strain.
We treat the networks we have as incidental but theyre fundamental to our well-being, says Nicky Forsythe, a psychotherapist and the founder of Talk for Health, an organization that trains people to give and receive support in groups.
Getting older doesnt have to mean getting lonelier, says Ruth Sutherland, the chief executive of the relationship counselling service Relate.
The researchers said oxytocin might increase the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations.
Autism is a developmental disorder that more than one in 100 people have.
Researchers at Yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a possible treatment for the social problems caused by autism because it plays an important role in bonding and trust.
Results have been mixed, though: one recent study found no significant benefit for young people given the chemical over several days.
But Pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions; it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to interact more socially, he said.
The scans were given 45 minutes after the young people inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray.
The scans showed that the reward circuits in the childrens brains behaved more normally after a dose of oxytocin: that is, they were more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when looking at the inanimate cars.
He warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and said people should not buy oxytocin online.
This is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key areas of the brain, said Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University.
A surprising finding, however, is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance in social recognition tasks.
Doctors should be cautious about the potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks, in much larger studies.
Uta Frith, who studies autism at University College London, said: According to this study, oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting.
Charles Gant, film editor for Heat magazine, says it is heading in the right direction.
It was simultaneously modern and retro.
A director mainly known for character studies such as American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, Mendes has taken the Bond series to new heights.
Gant says: Mendes managed to engage with both the modern and the traditional Bond audience, and he also attracted top actors like Ralph Fiennes.
Though the Bond series was not in trouble before Mendess arrival  and Craigs  there was a certain amount of staleness towards the end of Pierce Brosnans time as Bond.
This cycle, however, was nothing new: the history of the Bond series has been one of ebb and flow, revolving most obviously around the lead actor: first, Sean Connery; then, successively, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Brosnan and, now, Craig.
Lazenby only lasted a single film and Daltons two efforts, The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill, were during a period in the late 80s when the 007 movie was eclipsed by more aggressive, slick Hollywood action movies.
According to Gant, the period of Roger Moores last films, and the Dalton period, didnt really excite audiences.
If you adjust the figures for inflation, the 1965 release, Thunderball, is only just below Skyfall, while Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice both did better than the other Craig films (and the 70s Bonds, The Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let Die, did better, too).
Benjamin Carle is 96.9% made in France, including even his underpants and socks.
Carle, 26, decided, in 2013, to see if it was possible to live using only French-made products for ten months as part of a television documentary.
For the experiment, Carle had to give up his smartphone, television, refrigerator (all made in China); his glasses (Italian); his underpants (Moroccan); morning coffee (Guatemalan) and his favourite David Bowie music (British).
Fortunately, his girlfriend, Anas, and cat, Loon, are both French.
Politicians say all sorts of things.
He had just three rules: eat only food produced in France, remove any contact with foreign-made goods and do so on 1,800 a month (above the minimum wage of 1,430 to cover the extra expense of living in Paris).
The journalist was shocked to find out, at the start of the experiment, that only 4.5% of the contents of his flat were made in France  and that the rest would have to go, including the lightbulbs (China) and green beans (Kenya).
Left without a refrigerator (none are made in France), he was forced to chill his food on the window ledge.
His foreign-made clothes, including his underwear, were replaced with more expensive alternatives: French-produced underpants (26), socks (9), polo shirt (75), espadrille sandals (26), but no jeans because none are produced in France.
During the experiment, Carle hunted in supermarkets for 100% French-made products, learned to cook seasonal fruit and vegetables grown in France, proudly brushed his teeth with a toothbrush made in France and hand-washed his underwear until he found a French-made washing machine (which opened at the top and so would not fit under the kitchen counter).
Going out with friends was a problem  no American films, no Belgian beer, no sushi or pizza.
Staying home, with no sofa for the first few months and no television, meant listening to French singer Michel Sardou and reading French novels.
French wine was, of course, allowed and French-Canadian singer Cline Dion, but not French bands such as Daft Punk, who sing in English.
Unable to use his British-made bicycle or even a French car, because he discovered that the only affordable Peugeot, Renault and Citron models are mostly made overseas, he bought an orange Mobylette moped.
At one point, he asked a French language expert to check if he should use cool and other English words  he was advised to swap it for the nearest French equivalent: chouette.
When he discovered that France makes no refrigerators (apart from wine coolers) or televisions, but makes aeroplane seats and windmills, he sighed and said: Great.
It was trying to show that we should reflect about the way we buy and make different choices, and that applies in all countries.
He is not the first person to express scepticism about Mars One, a private mission that aims to send humans to live on Mars from 2025.
Roche, an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin who was announced in February as one of the 100 people shortlisted for the mission, has written for the Guardian expressing his doubts about the viability of Mars One.
The selection process, Roche writes, was not rigorous enough to reach the standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes.
Roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a top-ten list of candidates.
The official timeline for the mission says the group plans to send a stationary lander and satellite to Mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022.
In February, a supporter of the project, Gerard t Hooft, a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics, said he did not believe this timetable was realistic.
But, all of a sudden, it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a ten-minute Skype call.
He went on to say that, If a one-way mission to Mars ever became possible, I would always volunteer.
And so, like many others in Silicon Valley, the 27-year-old venture capitalist has come up with a start-up: BetterBoyfriend.me, a service that sends girlfriends and wives a present every month for about $70.
He tests his ideas by buying Facebook ads to see what kind of interest they get.
Another start-up, called InvisibleBoyfriend, allows users to design and build a believable partner who is everything you want and is always available to talk, whenever you want.
Founder Kyle Tabor launched it to give users a fake boyfriend to deter unwanted advances but has found people have grown attached to their imaginary partners: Many more users are looking for companionship through conversation rather than external proof of a relationship.
Early on, the packages he sent included receipts that had his name on them, Dan Sullivan.
One of the boyfriends wrote to me and said, Listen, shes not mad but Cynthia found out.
I looked for couples and gave the bouquet to the girl but the boyfriends didnt like that.
The last major United Nations (UN) assessment, in 2007, predicted temperature rises of 6 C or more by the end of the century.
As temperatures rise and oceans warm, tropical and subtropical regions will see sharp changes in annual rainfall, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released in Stockholm and published online in September.
East Africa can expect increased short rainfalls and west Africa should expect heavier monsoons.
Scientists in developing countries and commentators have welcomed the report, which they said supported their own observations.
The IPCC says that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before.
They do not need the IPCC to tell them that the weather is changing, said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development.
Although the global frequency of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease or remain unchanged, they may become more intense, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall.
Life in many developing-country cities could become unbearable, especially as urban temperatures are already far above those in surrounding countryside.
The charity Oxfam predicted that world hunger would worsen because climate changes inevitably hurt crop production and reduce incomes.
The changing climate is already jeopardizing gains in the fi ght against hunger, and it looks like it will get worse, said Oxfam.
This season, criticism of referees has increased so much that some former referees have started to complain about standards.
That is quite significant because, when you talk to referees, it is obvious that supporting each other through thick and thin is fundamental.
You might get an answer from the face of Lee Swabey moments after he blows the final whistle of a 21 win for Grimsby over Woking, a match at level 5 of the English league system.
A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, made their way to another level-5 match to watch another young referee  John Brooks.
It is all part of the experience Brooks needs to acquire before he is trusted with more important games, the different problems that need dealing with  often, clubs are very reluctant to have a late postponement, particularly when they have to pay all the staff who have come but will not receive any gate money.
A little later, the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time  the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is clear that these men do not do it for the money.
The former referees agree that the backup, education and tools that todays referees have is very different from what they experienced in their own days.
Riley, as a young referee, bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all.
The former referees agree that the backup, education and tools that todays referees have is very different from what they experienced in their own days.
Riley, as a young referee, bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all.
Contrast this with Brooks, who has a coach he can call.
Liam has taught us some techniques for forgetting that decision.
We are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the pitch, says Riley.
A mirror that sends heat into cold space has been designed by scientists to replace air-conditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth.
Researchers believe the mirror could slash the amount of energy used to control air temperatures in business premises and shopping centres because they wont need to use cooling systems.
You can signi cantly offset the electricity used for air conditioning, said Shanhui Fan, an expert in the study of light at Stanford University, who led the development of the mirror.
Hot-water boilers and cooking areas release heat into their immediate surroundings.
The Stanford mirror was designed to re ect 97% of the visible light that falls on it.
To make anything cool, you need what engineers call a heat sink: somewhere to put unwanted heat.
The Stanford mirror relies on the best heat sink: the universe itself.
The mirror is built from several layers of very thin materials.
On top of this are layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide.
These layers turn the mirror into a thermal radiator.
When silicon dioxide heats up, it radiates the heat as infrared light at a wavelength of around ten micrometres and the heat passes straight out to space.
In tests, the mirror had a cooling power of 40 watts per square metre at outside temperatures.

The project is a key part of Moroccos ambitions to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower.
In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies calculated that the worlds deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide power for all the people in the world for a whole year.
As engineers  nish Noor 1, its 500,000 moon-shaped solar mirrors glitter in the desert.
When they are  nished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will need a space as big as Moroccos capital city, Rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts of electricity, enough to power a million homes.
Moroccos environment minister, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same effects on the region this century that oil production had in the last century.
We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from other countries and that has big consequences for our state budget, el-Haite told the Guardian.
Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020.
Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours  this gives the possibility of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara and the surrounding region.
We are already involved in transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania, says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Societe d'Investissements Energetiques, the national renewable energy investment  rm.
Exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen).
In the meantime, Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs.
Over a thousand, mostly Moroccan, workers are still racing to  x electric wires, take down scaffolding and insulate steel pipelines.
Music subscription services, including Spotify and Deezer, have broken through the $1bn sales barrier worldwide, as fans choose to pay for music online.
Streaming and subscription revenues rose by more than 50% in 2013 to reach $1.1bn, and sales of recorded music in Europe grew for the  rst time in 12 years, according to  gures published in March.
While many people still listen for free, a desire for more choice is persuading more music lovers to part with their cash.
Easily accessible from smartphones and tablets, subscription services are popular with people who want to try out new music without buying a download or a CD.
The IFPI also said that One Direction were the biggest selling artists of 2013, with 4m physical and digital sales for their Midnight Memories album.
In Britain and America, streaming may soon generate more revenue for the music industry than downloads from online stores such as Apples iTunes.
Subscription services now account for a third of all digital sales globally, with downloads making up the rest, but the IFPI data shows that the two formats are growing at different rates.
In the US, the percentage of people using subscription services and streaming rose from 19% in 2012 to 23%, while the percentage of people downloading fell from 28% to 27%.
Digital formats now account for 39% of all music sales, or nearly 5.9bn out of 15bn, and, while sales of physical formats, such as CDs and vinyl, declined steeply in 2013, they still contribute just over half the industrys income.
Vinyl continued to make a comeback in some markets.
Shes been timing the speed of the queue on her phone ... and is that a tiny camera lens in her purse?
Im always given a scenario, such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range, but I can often buy whatever I want  and keep it.
Her income is around 30,000 to 40,000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job.
She  nds it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved.
Its estimated that more than 500,000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the UK, but just 10% or less manage to get regular work each month.
Nowadays, mystery shopping companies mostly give freebies to incentivize their workers.
At the most, well pay 15 to 25 plus reimbursement for, perhaps, a meal for two or a hotel stay.
Hannah, a 41-year-old lawyer, has done nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving 9 3 pay or travel expenses.
He had been on several previous missions but said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt.
Kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt much more sore when he returned to gravity than after shorter trips.
It was the fresh air mixed with the charred, kind of sweet smell of a spacecraft that had survived re-entry through the atmosphere.
The ISS, he said, is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team.
The Earth is a beautiful planet, he said, describing the beautiful waters around the Bahamas and the rainbow colours of the lakes of the northern Himalayas.
Besides the news, he said, steady work helped keep him sane: I tried to have milestones that were close, like when is the next crew arriving, the next spacewalk, the next science experiment.
That made a difference to me  it kept my sanity.
Ill soon start feeling that kind of culture shock, he said.
But I dont think I would ever say Im absolutely, 100%  nished, he added, because of the sudden successes of private space ight companies such as SpaceX.
Scientists have created an atlas of the brain that shows how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the brain.
Together, they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use: life and love, death and taxes.
It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking, said Alexander Huth, the main author of the study.
Then, they matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words produced brain responses in 50,000 to 80,000 pea-sized spots all over the cerebral cortex.
Per person, that was a total of about 25,000 words  and more than 3,000 different words  as they lay in the scanner.
The atlas shows how words and related terms light up the same regions of the brain.
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have several meanings.
One part of the brain, for example, responds to the word top, as well as other words that describe clothing.
Using the atlas, researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent very different concepts, from numbers to murder and religion.
He said that many studies just looked at brain activity when a single word or sentence was spoken but Gallants team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real-world scenario.
In the future, Hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity.
But, the brain atlas in its current form does not show small differences in word meanings.

Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans city government has begun trying to turn down the volume a bit.
With the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time,  ghting to implement a new noise ordinance.
This is just the wrong time for something like this, complains bar-owner William Walker, who hates the anti-smoking law.
Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to increase the tension thats already there.
Many of New Orleanss best bars and live music venues are in quiet residential neighbourhoods.
But, recently, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleanss musical personality feels at risk.
The Maple Leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014.
A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnt host music, says Zalia BeVille, manager of the All Ways Lounge.
Luckily, All Ways has an outdoor patio, unlike Lost Love Lounge, whose owner, Geoff Douville, loves the ban  hed previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar going.
Theres no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without a ban throughout the whole city, says Douville.
But, if I make that rule, customers walk down the block to a bar with smoking.
Back home in England, every pub I knew closed within a year of the smoking ban, remembers Timms of the UKs ban, begun in 2007.
But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity.
There are lots of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days  were now an option for all those people.
Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints: No court is going to say a bar is a nuisance after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well, she says.
We can have clean air without noise problems  I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.
The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana.
Bar customers are encouraged to  ll out a form or call 311 and to include photographs of illegal smoking.
Unworried, Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now.
In the end, Douville shares Cantrells optimism.
Of course theyre going to complain, he accepts.
But it doesnt mean theyre going to win. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change met recently in Copenhagen to present its latest report on the impacts and speed of climate change.
Our efforts to lower emissions must be intensi ed to avoid climate change getting out of control.
Focusing on what can be done, Sustainia Award, chaired by Arnold Schwarzenegger, celebrated ten leading sustainable solutions used in 84 countries.
From Switzerland, we learned how we can recycle and reuse old clothes and shoes more effectively.
The ten projects each offered unique solutions to sustainability challenges but it was the Nigerian initiative, Wecyclers, that won Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest of jurys vote.
By using bicycles to collect and recycle waste in Lagos, Wecyclers lets families exchange garbage for consumer goods via an SMS-based point system.
Recycling companies purchase Wecyclers sorted waste and make it into products such as mattresses, pillows and trash bags.
Wecyclers is a response to local waste problems, where its estimated that only 40% of the citys rubbish is collected.
According to the World Bank, only 46% of municipal waste in Africa is collected.
More than 5,000 households are involved and there are plans to extend the initiative to other cities throughout Nigeria.
Sustainability is not just about bringing down emissions, it is also a question of using our natural resources more intelligently and creating healthier lives for ourselves.
With a wide range of solutions for the wide range of challenges, we must focus more on the important part of the story that creates enthusiasm, momentum and that helps to create positive change. 
The tranquil sounds of the natural world might be lost to todays generation as people screen out the noises that surround them, a senior US researcher warns.
The problem was made worse by people listening to music through their earphones instead of tuning in to the birds and other sounds of nature that can easily be drowned out by traf c, music and others noises, he said.
This learned deafness is a real problem, Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose.
We are training ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears.
This gift that we are born with  to hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds  might be lost, he said.
For the past ten years, the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 places across the US, including Yosemite in California, Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska.
Its not surprising people are putting on earphones or even noise cancelling headphones to try and create a quieter environment, he said.
People quickly become used to changes in their environments, including rising noise levels, and, over time, Fristrup fears that we will accept far worse environmental conditions than we should and forget how much quieter the world could be.
The warning came as other scientists reported health bene ts from listening to natural sounds.
In one experiment, Taff told people who visited his lab to give an unplanned talk that would be judged by researchers standing behind a one-way mirror.
Measurements of their heart rate and the stress hormone, cortisol, before and after the speech found that people calmed down faster when they listened to nature recordings than when the same soundtracks also contained noises from road traf c, aeroplanes and even normal conversation.
Why natural sounds might be calming to people is unclear but Fristrup thinks that, over millions of years of evolution, we may have come to associate the more tranquil sounds of the natural world with safety.
Valter Piscedda, the mayor of Elmas, a small town near Sardinias capital, Cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave.
The council will pay for ten unemployed locals to take intensive English lessons, get on a cheap  ight and look for jobs elsewhere in Europe.
Over the past year and a half  especially in the past few months  I have been seeing young people, almost every day, who are despairing about their search for work.
So, my idea was this: put everything in place so that those who want to gain experience abroad are able to, he said.
For the Adesso Parto (Now Im leaving) programme, Elmass council will give 12,000 on a  rst-come,  rst-served basis to applicants aged between 18 and 50.
The idea of encouraging people to leave is sensitive at a time when huge numbers of Italians  many of them bright young graduates  are leaving their country every year.
But Piscedda, who belongs to the Democratic Party of the Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, believes that the people he is sending away might return and give me back 100 times what they were given.
It will allow them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or put burdens on families, he said.
Earlier in 2014, he added, the council launched a scheme for businesses  they were given  nancial incentives to hire young workers from Elmas.
In Elmas, the scheme has got mixed reactions.
The son of a friend of mine who didnt study much is in London and hes really  nding his way.
Piscedda, however, says of his online critics: Probably, they are people that arent in need ... Every day, I deal with peoples problems and I have to do something to try to solve them.
Robert Mys_ajek stops.
There are now about 1,500 wolves in Poland.
It ate a red deer, says Mys_ajek, the University of Warsaw biologist.
DNA tests have shown that Polish wolves are travellers.
asks student Alex Entwisle, 23, on a study trip to southern Poland from the UK.
He and other animal science students have spent the day looking for droppings and paw prints in the Beskidy mountains of the Polish Carpathians.
Mys_ajek toured the Scottish Highlands in 2015 for the Wolves and Humans Foundation and answered questions from villagers about the Polish experience.
We track them using motion cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow.
All pack members care for the young.
He is fascinated by these aloof animals who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable life as domestic dogs.
Mys_ajek advises farmers to put up electric fences.
In 1989, when the communists left power, Poland had only one motorway.
From the 1950s, hunting wolves was encouraged by the authorities.
The Environment Minister, Jan Szyszko, is a hunter.
It would be amazing for the environment to have wolves back in Scotland because of the problem of too many deer.
Organic food has more of the antioxidants linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides, according to the most comprehensive scienti c analysis so far.
The team, led by Professor Carlo Leifert, concludes that there are statistically signi cant differences, with a range of antioxidants being substantially higher  between 19% and 69%  in organic food.
It is the  rst study to demonstrate clear differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals.
The researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to one to two of the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant in terms of human nutrition.
The  ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people.
He added, Leifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people.
The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world  more than ever before  which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals.
Also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still far below recommended limits.
A further criticism of the research is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming.
The greatest criticism, however, will be over the suggestions of possible health bene ts.
The most recent major analysis, which included 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence.
This was also the conclusion of earlier, smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the UK Food Standards Agency.
Opinion polls show healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemical residues (53%) are key reasons given by shoppers for buying organic produce.
Browning said: This research con rms what people think about organic food.
In other countries, there have, for a long time, been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming.
To a traditional navigator like Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands, a canoe is much more than just a means of transport.
The canoe is our island, the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader, Pittman says.
He continues, On a canoe, you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds.
It has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes since arriving in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress.
Around 100 crew members were involved in the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques.
Unfortunately, said Tua, the crews had to rely on modern navigation equipment at times to reach Australia in time for the Congress.
It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Oceania Regional Of ce and  ve Paci c Island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Fiji.
Our coral reefs, the greatest in the world and our spawning grounds are disappearing.
Growing global populations and unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life.
According to the IUCN, in 2013, the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take (no  shing).
This was despite a target of 20-30% no-take areas set by the last World Parks Congress in 2003.
Marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts was one of the scientists who helped set the 20-30% target in 2003.
After dif cult negotiations, the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically change the goals for global marine management.
Its a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard.
He also said that pollution was getting worse, particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as Sydney.
And climate change is already beginning to have a serious effect on Paci c Islanders.
The decisions of the big countries impact on the small countries twice, three times, four times more than they impact on developed, large nations.
PizzaExpress branches are to be targeted by protesters, in an attempt to get the restaurant chain to stop taking a proportion of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards.
Campaigners have also started an online petition in the hope that restaurant-goers will support their demands.
PizzaExpress keeps, as an admin fee, 8p out of every 1 paid when tips are given by card.
The chain, which has 430 branches around the UK and is particularly popular with families, makes around 1m a year from the practice, according to the union Unite.
We believe this 8% fee is unfair and that, if the chain values its staff, it should be paying them the total tips they are given by customers, said Chantal Chegrinec of Unite.
We are starting with PizzaExpress but they are not the only ones and we will turn our attention to other companies after this.
The  rst is taking place at the British Museum branch of PizzaExpress in London.
The union has also written to the restaurant chains CEO.
So you see my colleagues and I are very reliant on customer tips to top up our low wages.
Ask and Zizzi, two other restaurant chains, also deduct 8% of the tips paid by card.
Cafe_ Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%; so do Strada and Giraffe.
A spokesperson for PizzaExpress said that its admin charge was to cover the cost of running a tronc  a pay arrangement used to distribute tips among staff.
Frankie & Bennys, Chiquitos and Garfunkels used to charge 10% but they stopped doing this several years ago.
But the employee who wrote to Unite said that, when she mentioned the charge to customers, they were always surprised.
Most customers would then pay the tip in cash.
Almost 6,000 people have signed Unites online petition.
I work in a busy London branch and, on an average night, I serve 150 people and earn 40 to 50 in tips, he says.
That might sound like a lot but that money is crucial to me because my basic pay is only 6.50 an hour.
The research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms, which means less sunlight is reflected back into space.
The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change.
4C would be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous, Sherwood said.
The research reduces the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, according to scientists commenting on the study, published in the journal Nature.
Experts at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was convincing and agreed that this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected.
Scientists measure the sensitivity of the Earths climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere compared with pre-industrial levels  which is likely to happen within 50 years.
Computer climate models are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures and it was important to make sure that the way clouds are formed was represented accurately in those models.
Furthermore, a study in November 2013 suggested the pause may be mainly an illusion  a result of the lack of temperature readings from polar regions, where warming is greatest.
Sherwood accepts his teams work on the role of clouds cannot definitely rule out that future temperature rises will be at the lower end of projections.
The report found that, in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa, 30 to 40% of people who escaped from poverty fell back again, rising to 60% in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009.
Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion was 20%.
Lovemore, from Zimbabwe, has become one of the poorest people in his village.
He recently lost his job due to bad health and had to take in his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters.
The big gains in China are unlikely to be matched by similar progress elsewhere, while climate-related shocks and deep poverty in parts of sub-Saharan Africa will slow down progress.
The report says the focus should be on the chronically poor  those who are poor for many years or their entire lives  and on stopping the descent into poverty.
The report says progress on poverty reduction has had less of an impact on the chronically poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line.
The  rst is social assistance  to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living.
The third is economic growth policies that ensure that the bene ts of increasing national prosperity reach the very poorest people.
Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person, Shepherd said.
The authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure that the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social norms, such as dowries and witchcraft, that contribute to extreme poverty: This often means challenging parts of the status quo.     
Now Singerer, a childminder, has joined FemAle, a group of like-minded drinkers in Gothenburg, to make and sell Swedens  rst beer made by women.
We Can Do It was the brainchild of Felicia Nordstro_m, a bar worker who says she was fed up with male beer snobs telling her: What do you know about beer, sweetie?
She talked to FemAle, and they teamed up with Ocean, a local independent micro-brewery.
One weekend they came up with the recipe and the next weekend they brewed 1,600 litres.
FemAle has already been approached by other breweries who want to brew new beers with them.
Women choose a glass of wine because they dont know what beer is all about; they dont know what to order, says Carlsson.
From all across Rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring Burundi, people are coming to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza (Sweet Dreams).
They come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted before  sweet, cold ice cream.
The shop, which has ice cream, coffee, dreams written on its signs, is taking advantage of local curiosity about the dessert  and changing lives in the process, says Inzozi Nzizas manager, Louise Ingabire.
The shop can certainly make dreams come true.
Inzozi Nziza has become a meeting place for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.
Most of the ingredients are from local sources and the milk comes from nearby Nyanza.
An ice-cream shop, Katese said, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions, Miesen says.
At the start, Miesen and Dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. After 18 months, they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved they could run the business.
The Butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with Ingoma Nshya, Rwandas  rst and only female drumming group, which was established by Katese ten years ago.
Some are survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million Tutsis and Hutus were killed.
When Im drumming, it gives me power because were still alive and survivors, she says.
Sweet Dreams, which tells the story of how the women have made a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.
We feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life, says Lisa Fruchtman.     
McKinlay believes we need huge investment before navigation systems will be good enough for technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off.
According to Ofcom (the Of ce of Communications), around 66% of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015, up from 39% in 2012  so GPS technology is widely available.
But McKinlay, a satellite communication and navigation consultant, believes that we should be careful not to leave our navigational needs to our devices.
We looked at a group of current London taxi drivers and a group of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years, said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers of University College London, who is an author of the study.
The results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than the current taxi drivers.
We were able to show that their abilities dropped away if they werent using their knowledge.
There is a genuine potential danger in relying on a satnav, said Spiers.
But the health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known.
Spiers believes the development of arti cial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids, but McKinlay is sceptical.
We will see ever-smarter machines which are very, very task speci c, but the big breakthrough will be when they understand what we are thinking and what we want to achieve, he said.
She has a series of adventures as Johansson and, in the end, dies in a car crash.
Delacourt tried to explain that he chose to mention Johansson because she is the archetype of beauty today.
Delacourt is one of Frances best-loved authors; his previous novel, My List of Desires, was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a  lm.
I wrote a real love story about feminine beauty, especially interior beauty.
I thought she might send me  owers as the book was a declaration of love for her, but she didnt understand, Delacourt said.     
A study by one of the UKs leading experts on childrens physical activity has found that school pupils born in those months are  tter than everyone else in their class.
November- and October-born children were  tter, stronger and more powerful than those born in the other ten months of the year, especially those whose birthdays were in April or June.
Dr Gavin Sandercock of Essex University and colleagues found that autumn-born children had a clear physical advantage over their classmates.
The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport.
The gap in physical ability between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide.
The results show that something other than the relative-age effect  the greater maturity of those born early in the school year  is the cause, especially as the  ttest children were not the tallest or heaviest, he added.
The authors believe that autumn-born childrens greater exposure over the summer months, towards the end of pregnancy, to vitamin D is the most likely explanation.
Seasonal differences in vitamin D concentrations in the womb seem most plausible, they say.
Children that get a high-quality  rst experience are those that will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up, he said.
UK Sport could not say if a disproportionate majority of the 1,300 athletes across 47 sports it funds were born in November and October.
She said: With elite, senior athletes, there are many factors that make a champion and our work hasnt uncovered anything to suggest that month of birth is one of the key ingredients. 
As soon as the children at one primary school in Stirling, Scotland, hear the words daily mile, they put down their pencils and leave the classroom to start running around the school  eld.
For three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at St Ninians Primary School have walked or run a mile each day.
They do it at different times during the day and, despite the rise in childhood obesity across the UK, none of the children at the school are overweight.
One in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or  ve, according to the Health & Social Care Information Centre, and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in England are the least  t they have ever been.
Primary schools therefore accept the bene ts of the daily mile.
In Stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or will soon start the daily mile.
They come back inside bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked, how children used to look, said Wyllie.
The extent of the bene ts isnt known yet but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile.
Dr Colin Moran, who is leading the study, said: The children dont seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things.
St Ninians pupils will be compared with children from another school in Stirling that hasnt yet started the scheme.
Kevin Clelland, a primary school teacher from Leeds, visited St Ninians and, then, convinced his colleagues it was a great idea.
Active Cheshire, a sports and  tness organization in Cheshire, is taking a group of senior people from the local authority up to Scotland to assess the results of the daily mile.
The hope is to introduce it across the 450 schools in their region if a pilot programme is successful.
Paralympian, Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of ukactive, a health organization for physical activity, said: All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground.
The Scottish government also supports the initiative.
Now, for the  rst time, scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria in a citys subway  and they have found many interesting results.
Dr Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College, led a team that, for 18 months, tested the New York City subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles, seats, ticket booths and stations.
His team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan.
Some of the results were expected and should be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands, Mason said.
All around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses  brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella found on New York pizza  appeared.
The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more limited to midtown Manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and Bay Ridge.
Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, as well as E.coli, and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city.
In fact, he added, Ive become much more con dent riding the subway.
The next steps, Mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in Paris, Sa_o Paolo and Shanghai, and continued studies of New York, for instance to see how the results change with the seasons.
He said he hoped the research would provide a baseline of research for health of cials and geneticists, and could help health of cials to prevent and track diseases and pathogens. 
The UK prime minister, David Cameron, has declared a clear result in the Scottish independence referendum  Scotland voted by a 10.6-point margin against ending the 307-year- old union with England and Wales.
Earlier, Scotlands  rst minister, Alex Salmond, remained de ant at a Scottish National Party rally in Edinburgh  he said he accepted Scotland had not, at this stage, decided to vote for independence.
The yes campaign won four big successes  it won 53% of the vote in Scotlands largest city, Glasgow, 57% in Dundee and 51% in North Lanarkshire.
However, the no campaign was victorious in 28 authorities.
It won easily in areas where it was expected to do well, including Edinburgh, Aberdeenshire and Borders, but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign, including the Western Isles.
In the  nal count, the no camp won 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) and the yes camp won 1,617,989 votes (44.7%).
And I know that feeling was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future.
Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party, said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change.
We know our country needs to change.
Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the referendum was not only a new chapter for Scotland within the UK but also wider constitutional reform across the union.
He said a vote against independence was not a vote against change.
Yet that result raises the risk of further problems  MPs from Camerons Conservative Party are threatening to vote against the prime ministers promise to quickly increase the Scottish parliaments powers and protect its spending.
The prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main UK party leaders will meet the commitments they made during the referendum campaign.
SeaWorld has suffered an 84% collapse in pro ts  customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company because of claims that it mistreated orca whales.
After the documentary was shown, attendance collapsed and the company lost more than half of its market value on Wall Street.
Talking about the companys reputation, he said, Early feedback on our campaign has been positive.
We will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side, he said.
Manby, who joined the company as CEO in 2015 to help the company recover, said he would give a presentation on his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 November.
There are already plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a naturalistic setting.
Jared Goodman, director of animal law for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), said: SeaWorld has a spying scandal, animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people are against its plan to build a new orca prison.
SeaWorlds shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, fell to just under $18 in August 2015. 
Stratford remained hugely important during Shakespeares life, says Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
People often see Shakespeare as someone who turned his back on Stratford and his family, went to London to earn his fortune and only came back to die, he said.
The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be celebrated across Britain and the globe.
In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to showcase each of Shakespeares plays.
The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and nearly every other theatre production company in the country will celebrate the anniversary.
The plays would probably not have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every bit of every play they could  nd  drafts, prompt scripts, scribbled actors parts and 17 plays not known in any other version  into the precious First Folio published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeares death.
The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust describes New Place as the jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrations.
The low rumble of passing ships has, for a long time, been connected to the disturbance of large whales.
But, US researchers have also found noise at medium and higher frequencies, including at 20,000Hz where killer whales, also known as orcas, hear best.
The  ndings suggest that the noise could affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes up the west coast of the USA.
The main concern of this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales, said Scott Veirs, who led the research.
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State, USA.
The two-year study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of vessel, including cruise ships, container ships and military vehicles, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.
Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels  around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner.
But, the new research shows the threat to smaller whales, dolphins and porpoises.
Ships have been thought of as low-frequency sources of noise, like the rumbling of lorries or trains, he said.
And, if they fail to  nd prey as effectively, they will need to use up their stores of extra blubber.
This is a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if they are released fully into their systems.
Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near them.
Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be simple ways of transferring that technology to commercial ships.
Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half.
While some whale species, such as blue whales, the largest mammal on Earth, are safer now because whaling has declined, others are still under threat from a range of factors.
The US federal government has recently protected nearly 40,000 square miles of the Atlantic to try to avoid losing a species of whale with just 500 individuals left.
In Europe, killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned chemicals in their blubber.
Meanwhile, around the coast of Australia, whales face an increased threat from ship strikes and oil and gas drilling, as well as Japans recent decision to start whaling again in Antarctic waters. 
What surprised researchers was not how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it.
Some found it so unbearable that they took the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks to break the tedium.
The difference, scientists suspect, is that men are typically more sensation-seeking than women.
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities tries to answer the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.
In more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that people hated being left to think, regardless of their age, education, income or the amount of time they spent on smartphones or social media.
Timothy Wilson, who led the work, said the  ndings were not necessarily due to the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media.
Instead, those things might be popular because of our constant need to do something rather than nothing.
In the  rst experiments, students were taken  alone, without phones, books or anything to write with  into a room and told to think.
To see if the effect was found only in students, the scientists tested more than 100 other people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmers market.
To check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students were given the option of giving themselves a mild electric shock.
They had been asked earlier to say how unpleasant the shocks were, compared to other options, such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle.
Jessica Andrews-Hanna at the University of Colorado said many students would probably give themselves an electric shock to cheer up a tedious lecture.
But, she says we need to know more about the motivation of the shockers in Wilsons study.
Imagine  a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there with their thoughts, she said.
As they sit there, their mind starts to wander and it naturally goes to that shock  was it really that bad?   
If you pick up a boot, a camera will make sure you dont put it into your bag.
Intel spokesman Joe Jensen says that the aim of using RealSense technology in shops is not to create databases of speci c peoples lives but to build generalized models of peoples lifestyles and shopping habits.
We dont need to know a particular customer.
We need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and that, when those characteristics are present, this is what a person tends to do.
That could allow a store to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed speci cally at that person.
If you search for something on Amazon, youll get targeted ads for similar products on other sites.
People do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to browser cookies.
Hoxton Analytics, a team of data scientists in London, has developed a technology that uses machine learning and arti cial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing.
By analysing the style and size of peoples footwear as they walk past the sensor, the system can identify a customers gender with 75-80% accuracy.
Owen McCormack, Hoxton Analytics CEO, says that the focus of the system was partly a reaction to facial recognition.
My idea was, why dont we simply consider the clothes someones wearing?
If I just showed you a photo of someones body, you could probably tell me what gender they are.
However, pointing a camera at someones chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition.
People use the word creepy a lot during discussions of in-store tracking.
From the perspective of stores, its understandable that physical shops want some of the information online shops collect.
In any case, there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what youre wearing.     
They may not know who Steve Jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces, but the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, according to a new report.
The arrival of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, Ofcom (which checks standards in the UK communications industries) says in its annual study of British consumers.
As a result of growing up in the digital age, they are developing completely different communication habits from older generations, even compared to the 16-to-24 age group.
800 children and 2,000 adults took Ofcoms digital quotient, or DQ, test, which attempts to gauge awareness of and self-con dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches, knowledge of superfast internet, 4G mobile- phone networks and mobile apps.
Digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years old, with a DQ of 113, and then drops gradually throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly in old age.
The ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now believe their preferences to be a better indication of the future than the preferences of trendsetting young adults.
Two decades ago, teenagers spent their evenings monopolizing the home telephone line, talking about love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours.
Just 2% of childrens time using devices is spent emailing, compared to 33% for adults.
They spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips on Facebook and other social sites.
Young adults aged 16 to 24 are big media consumers.
They call him the Robin Hood of the banks, a man who took out many loans worth almost half a million euros with no intention of ever paying them back.
Instead, Enric Duran gave the money to projects that created and promoted alternatives to capitalism.
After 14 months in hiding, Duran is unapologetic, even though his activities could put him in jail.
Im proud of what I did, he said in an interview by Skype from a secret location.
Meanwhile, constant growth was creating a system that created money out of nothing.
He spent two months in prison before being let out on 50,000 bail.
His actions, he said, were an important part of a worldwide debate on the economic crisis.
In his case, he said, he could offer banks the insight he got from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently.
More than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected afterwards and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
Suddenly aware of Donana's status as the nation's most important natural site, Spain decided to spend a further 360m, some of it EU money, on restoring the landscape.
However, the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Donana in 1998.
Donana already faces a large number of threats, but now they want to bring back the very cause of the disaster 16 years ago.
The crash of Spain's banks in 2008 had a catastrophic effect on the region and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30%.
Reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 jobs.
There are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants, said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero.
People have been digging metals here since Roman times.
Fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste.
The plan has some support in the area, but it also has a lot of opposition.
Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the plan.
This is a very, very bad idea, he said.
This is not surprising because this is a very special place.
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago.
This point is supported by Davila.
After the disaster, Spain realized that it had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added.
That movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star, a key part of the story in the  rst  lm in 1977.
In creating a multi-storyline, multi-character cinema universe around Star Wars, Lucas lm-Disney are copying the phenomenally successful series of  lms produced by Marvel Studios, which Disney also bought, in 2009.
Disney has increased the level of marketing savvy to a product that was already popular: Dergarabedian says the decision to make all six existing Star Wars  lms available on streaming services is a brilliant way to build the excitement for the new  lm and reinvigorate the idea of Star Wars in the minds of the fans.
Michael Rosser, news editor for Screen International, suggests that it is this shared universe of nostalgia that makes Star Wars the top  lm franchise.
Rosser is referring to the three  lms Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005  The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith  which were about the life of Luke Skywalkers father, Anakin, who becomes Darth Vader.
It shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still made a lot of money, said Rosser.
They also want people to go to the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment.
Meanwhile, Dergarabedian expects massive business when The Force Awakens reaches cinemas in December 2015.
We certainly expect a record opening for December and the  lm should make at least a billion dollars worldwide.
We may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is just as exciting and almost as far-fetched.
Experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally changing transportation.
Theres a tighter connection between transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.
Connectivity Ride-sharing services like Uber  taxis booked via smartphone  and apps like Waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city.
People still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to Waze.
Companies are working to develop technology that will allow a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.
But, even if driverless technology were ready to use now, it would take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.
DNA taken from the wisdom tooth of a European hunter-gatherer has given scientists a glimpse of modern humans before the rise of farming.
He was probably lactose intolerant and had more difficulty digesting starchy foods than the farmers whose diets and lifestyles changed in the first agricultural revolution.
But scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had on the human immune system, because tests on the hunter-gatherers DNA found that he already carried genes that boost the immune system.
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cave explorers found two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006.
Carbon dating put the remains at around 7,000 years old, before farming arrived in Europe from the Middle East.
It is the first time researchers have got the complete genome of a modern European who lived before the Neolithic revolution.
The results suggest that blue eye colour came first in Europe and that the change to lighter skin happened throughout Mesolithic times.
You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eyes, Lalueza-Fox said.
The Spanish team compared the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related.
Martin Jones, professor of archaeological science at Cambridge University, said the immunity genes were the most interesting result.
Two mothers in South Africa have found out that they are raising each others daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010.
But, while one of the women wants to correct the error and get her biological child back, the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own.
Henk Strydom, a lawyer for one of the mothers, described the swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending.
Strydom said: The man denied he was the father.
Here they have met their biological daughters  Strydom said of his client: She said there are resemblances to herself.
The woman became unhappy with the process and asked the childrens court to give her custody of her biological child, but the other mother refused.
She wants the baby back, but its four years later: you can understand that the other mother doesnt want to give up her baby, Strydom said.
The High Court in Pretoria has asked the University of Pretorias Centre for Child Law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children.
He said, at this point, he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department, which is helping with the case and providing counselling.
The children and mothers will have clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist.
It is not the first child-swap case in South Africa.
He grew up on welfare and became a truck driver, whereas his biological brothers and sisters  and the boy brought up in his place  attended private secondary schools and universities.
There are many quirky solutions to help make our cities more livable, such as glow-in-the-dark trees, underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins.
City living has many upsides but a sustainable lifestyle is not always one of them.
Pollution, traf c and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily problems that city-dwellers have to deal with.
Take an empty car park, a small amount of money and a pot plant or two, and make yourself your own private park.
Subterranean storage Not all urban dwellers have cars.
Just seven metres wide, the cylindrical storage facility buries deep into the ground and can hold 204 bikes.
Glow-in-the-dark trees When most people think of trees that glow in the dark, Christmas trees usually come to mind.
The Dutch designer-artist has invented a bioluminescent plant.
The experimental technology joins DNA from luminescent marine bacteria with the chloroplast genome of a plant to create a glow like a jelly sh.
Few people probably notice the springiness beneath their feet.
The  oor has smart tiles that capture the energy from pedestrians footsteps and convert it into electricity.
Pavegen, the UK company who had the idea, has installed a similar system at Londons Heathrow Airport and other international locations.
Up to 50 metres high, these steel-framed supertrees not only have  owers growing up them  their metallic canopies absorb and disperse heat, too.

The Greek island of Agios Efstratios is so remote, so forgotten by the banks, the government and most of the modern world that there isnt a single ATM or credit-card machine on the island.
Residents have to make nine-hour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and Greek visitors say they cant get hold of enough money to come.
Tourist numbers have reduced by 80% this year, said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up, with a population of around 200 people.
Kakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks but she still feels it may be too late for this season on an island where tourism is the main source of income: We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we have people calling us up asking to  nd a room and we cant help them.
Everything, even milk or bread, has been bought and sold three or four times before it gets to us and everyone has to take a pro t, said Provatas Costas, a 58-year-old  sherman.
Lemnos has dozens of wild beaches, where you can swim and sunbathe virtually alone, a small nightlife scene and many cultural sites.
If taxes go up, even more young people will leave, warns Mayor Kakali, who has worked to improve education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families.
There are too many festivals and there are not enough big acts to headline them.
So, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows.
There is going to be a growth in events where it isnt just music but with poetry or books or magic shows.
There will be lots of small combination festivals that give something extra  not people standing around in a big  eld unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band.

Cathal Redmond was swimming off the Greek coast and he was sure he had taken some great photos of colourful  sh with his  rst underwater camera.
He took the pictures while holding his breath underwater and blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots.
He decided to invent something to make that little extra time a reality and the result is his invention of the Express Dive  a re llable air storage device, which is held in the mouth and lets people swim underwater for two minutes.
So, rather than just go underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath, I wanted people to do a little bit more, says Redmond, 27.
The real problem is that scuba diving is very limiting.
It was during a  nal-year project for his product design degree that Redmond produced the Express Dive.
When above the surface, the unit sucks in air through a vent in the mouthpiece.
When air is no longer being taken in, the vent shuts off and, as the person dives, air is fed back via the mouthpiece.
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll.
He compares it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater.
It is an extension of the bodys ability to store air, he says.
Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes worth of air into the unit and that the design can be held in the divers mouth.
But, with enough testing, Redmond is con dent he can get a fully working device that will not endanger swimmers underwater.
To anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a very small improvement on snorkelling, Redmond says it could make a big difference underwater.

His billing, The Beale Street Blues Boy, was shortened to Blues Boy King and then to BB.
He was always ready to praise the musicians who had in uenced him  he would usually mention T-Bone Walker  rst.
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style.
The 1965 album Live at the Regal, however, has become iconic, a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians.
He had further R&B hits with blues numbers including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss, and, in 1969, he got near the top of the pop charts  where no blues artist had been for many years  with The Thrill Is Gone.
About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, all of a sudden, kids started saying to me, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.

Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent ex-smokers, who are the vast majority of vapers, may already be declining.
Figures released in 2014 by the health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) reveal that usage among adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes  which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour, not smoke  has tripled from 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014.
However,  gures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study, a research organization that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends, show vapings appeal may be declining.
The drop is described as statistically signi cant by Professor Robert West, who collates the  gures for the Toolkit.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers.
Weve only been studying vaping for just over a year, so its a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes.
Vaping rates might change but, at this stage, it looks like theyre staying the same.
The fact that vaping has stopped growing in popularity in the UK seems to be at odds with what is happening in the US, where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where reports suggest it is growing in popularity.
Instead, e-cigarettes seem to be most popular among adults who want to quit.
While the  gures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has stopped rising, their data also shows the huge increase in use since May 2011, said James Dunworth, of ecigarettedirect.co.uk.
E-cigarettes behave like a sort of nicotine patch, West agreed.
The European Commission (EC) is looking at increasing taxes on e-cigarettes, which could have an impact on their popularity.
This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to get the same effect, again something that may make e-cigarettes more expensive.
West suggested that policymakers should see e-cigarettes as an aid to stopping smoking and not have the same regulations for them as for smoking.
It just sounds like youre having a go at vapers and that undermines the public health messages were trying to get out.
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York do not even enter the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.
Helena Hartlauer, 32, from Vienna, said she was not surprised at her citys top position.
The citys social democratic government has a long tradition of investing money in high-quality social housing, which makes Vienna less expensive than other major cities.
I live in a 100sq-metre apartment in a good area about 20 minutes walk from the city centre.
A similar apartment in London would cost over 2,000 and even more in New York, ranked 44th in the table.
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you go abroad, said Hartlauer.
Vienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the Berlin Wall, becoming the gateway to Eastern European countries that often have historic connections to the former Austro-Hungarian empire.
Our big USP (unique selling point) is our geographical location, said Martin Eichtinger, Austrian ambassador to London, who lived in Vienna for 20 years.
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped make Vienna a hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe.
According to the World Bank, Austria has one of the highest  gures for GDP (gross domestic product) per person in the world, just behind the US and ahead of Germany and Britain, although below neighbouring Switzerland.
Mercer says Zurich in Switzerland has the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun.
Its a very fast growing, young and lively city, she added.
But, after an increase in budget  ights from British cities such as Manchester and Edinburgh, Vienna is becoming a more popular destination.
Vienna has ranked top in the last seven surveys, said Mercer.
It scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high standard of public transport and good recreational facilities.
Paris has remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places, said Mercer.
Australian cities also do well in the survey, with Sydney 10th and Melbourne 15th.
All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping policy.
Elle, 22, Edinburgh: We never know whether its fair Average tips: 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France  I have three part-time catering jobs.
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never see how much the tip is  so we dont know whether what we get is fair or not.
The system seems better in France, where they dont tip much but being a waiter is seen as a proper job, with job security and a decent income.
Or, when a member of the team does incredibly well, they dont get what theyve earned.
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without taking our tips.
I make around 20 a shift in tips but often I only get 10-15 of that money.
Id rather we earned a good basic wage (like in Australia) and didnt have to rely on tips.
Tom, Manchester: A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips: 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy  Where I used to work, waiters kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips.
The other 20% of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and bar staff.
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around 40.
They have got tipping right in Italy, where customers dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if their meal is 19, they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change.

School and university reunions are unnecessary  you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youve seen pictures of your schoolmates babies.

Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group.
Ninety- one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.
More than 80% of Facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively.
But most younger users limit who can see their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.
3 Facebook has created millions of jobs  but not in its own of ces Facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make Facebook work for their brand.
Marketers have an understanding of a brands customers like they have never had before.
The data available is extraordinary.
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook.
Manchester Universitys Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine.
Many of the people interviewed in Onuchs research said they relied on Facebook for the truth about what was happening  they dont trust traditional media.
For better or (often) worse, it is a place to  nd information on almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the days biggest news story.
In 2014, ten years after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a Facebook account.
This includes about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat.
By 2050, food production will have to increase by 60%, compared to 2005 levels, to feed a growing global population.
The problem is global but appears in very different ways.
In wealthy countries, there are low levels of food loss but high levels of food waste, which means food is thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict standards of appearance.
The carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at 3.3 gigatonnes of CO2  this means that, if food waste were a country, it would be the third highest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China.
About 30% of available agricultural land is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted.
And more surface and groundwater is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country, including India and China.
Climate change is caused by our economy of production and consumption because it is out of balance with what the Earth can provide, says van Otterdijk.
Production of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world and, if one-third of all this is wasted, you can imagine what a huge effect this has on the natural resources  on land, water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions.
The places that waste the most food are the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, where consumers waste 39% of all food purchased.
This means that 11.7% of all food purchased is wasted, which costs each family 700 a year.
The most wasted food in the UK by weight is bread, with consumers throwing away 414,000 tonnes (22.4%) of all bread purchased.
The UK has made progress in the past ten years after a campaign to reduce waste.
Between 2007 and 2012, the amount of food waste produced by UK households decreased by 21%, from 5.3m tonnes to 4.2m tonnes, largely due to greater awareness.
Van Otterdijk says there has been a very encouraging, unexpected, continuing interest in food waste and this enables campaigns around the world to gain momentum.
But, if it continues like this, maybe, after ten years, well have globally signi cant results.   
Clay Cockrell is sitting in his of ce across the street from 1 Central Park West, the address of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.
Cockrell, a former Wall Street worker who is now a therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people  Many of the extremely wealthy  the 1% of the 1%  feel that their problems are really not problems.
So, what issues do Americas 1% have?
And, then, there is the isolation  being in the 1% can be lonely.
The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% as something negative, said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group.
Traeger-Muney runs a global business and specializes in working with inheritors, who often get a bad reputation in the press.
You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealthy people.
But its harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money.
According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of US households with $1m or more  excluding the value of their main home  increased by 500,000 to 10.1m.
Since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has grown and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy, Cockrell said.
Never being able to trust your friendships with other people, I think that is dif cult, said Cockrell.
These are real fears of the richest of the rich.
In 2007, the Gates Foundation and Boston Colleges Center on Wealth and Philanthropy started to document what it felt like to be in Americas 1%.
For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of Americas richest households  120 of those households have at least $25m.
The report, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old saying that money cant buy happiness.
Some Americans keep their wealth secret.
There are a lot of people that hide their wealth because they are worried about negative judgment, said Traeger-Muney.
Speaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to tell him all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them.
According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), there were only 41m subscribers using music streaming services around the world in 2014.
Some sources suggest that Apple is aiming to reach 100m subscribers, which, based on a subscription fee of $120 per year, would generate $12bn annually.
Apple is good at making products go mainstream but its not that good.
Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business with an estimated 70% market share.
Apple holds the lions share of this  it is biggest music retailer in the world.
But download revenue reached a peak in 2013 in the UK at 283m and fell to 249m in 2014.
The decline in download sales hit the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for $3bn in order to get into the premium headphone market and, also, to make the transition from music ownership (downloads) to music access (subscription streaming).
Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet  so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand.
The average spend of a music buyer in the UK in 2014, for example, was just 39.52.
Apple have previously tried to be artist-friendly via iTunes.
It didnt work.
There is the smell of revolution in the air and Apple is making sure its on the right side of the battle.
This is going to be the interesting bit when the service goes live.
Getting exclusives for big albums will be crucial to streaming.
Apple was watching this carefully and making notes.
Nowadays, its lowest point, Piazza San Marco (only three feet above sea level) is inundated with water approximately 100 times a year.
In Venice, subsoil compaction (a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area) lowered the city by 20cm between 1950 and 1970.
Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year  but thats nothing compared to Jakarta, which is dropping 10 to 20cm each year.
Unfortunately for the Indonesian capital, it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting  this has created a bowl.
While there are many plans to save Venice  and Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are taking the problem seriously  the same cannot be said for Miami, where politicians refuse to admit the city has a serious environmental problem.
It is less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city; and it is built on porous rock, which is absorbing the rising seawater.
This water then  lls the citys foundations and comes up through drains and pipes, forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water.
In the Maldives, the populations of whole islands are now considering abandoning their homes.
The capital, Male_, population 153,379 and only four feet above sea level, has built a ten-foot sea wall at a cost of $63 million  but, long term, only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islands.
This city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human over-expansion.
Californias dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million (in 1870)  but now the state is home to 38 million people, who own 32 million vehicles.
The daily water use in Rancho Mirage is more than 200 gallons per person, which is causing a man-made drought.
A 25% cut in water use has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort, which is surrounded by sand and dust.
The long-term answer in Californias desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities.
Fire is a growing threat to urban settlements in America  in fact, forest  res cause the most damage after severe storms, with 800 major  re disasters there between 1953 and 2014.

Im ready to give up at 45 seconds but I continue and it seems to get easier for a while.
By the end of the session, Id managed 90 seconds of breath-holding, enough to let me swim a width.
I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.
Some even say that humans have an ability to lower their heart rate in order to breath-hold for even longer.
And evidence shows that our heart rate doesnt drop during breath-holding.
This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes called the mammalian diving re ex.
While our ability to breath-hold may not be special, when we compare ourselves with other animals, its now becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine.
Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation, very precisely, at the tumour.
This may require several minutes of radiation and, so, its usually done in short periods, between breaths.
But, if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes, it means that the entire dose can be given, in the right place, in one go.
The problem, of course, is that most people, just like me, cannot hold their breath for much longer than a minute.
When you breathe in, youre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm  at so that the volume of your chest increases  and air is pulled into your lungs.
If you arti cially raise oxygen levels and reduce carbon dioxide levels before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, you may be able to delay tiredness in the diaphragm.
First, he outraged prisoners of war by doubting the heroism of Vietnam veteran John McCain because he allowed himself to be captured.
Trump has also insulted Mexican immigrants to the US, claimed that a Black Lives Matter protester who was violently thrown out of a rally deserved to be roughed up, appeared to laugh at a New York Times journalist for his disability and falsely accused Muslim Americans of supporting the 9/11 attackers.
But, he has refused to retract any of the comments.
Some rivals still hope that, eventually, even Trumps supporters will get tired of his attacks on minorities.
As he is happy to tell supporters, the three things that he is most against  immigration reform, free-trade deals and Barack Obamas national security policy  have become perhaps the most important issues of the election.
might sound unrealistic but they have destroyed the campaign hopes of Jeb Bush, who favours immigration reform.
Among Americans who say they are Republicans, current polls suggest he has 25-30% of the vote.
In the political battle for hearts and minds, converting Trumps passionate supporters will be hard.
This scenario can be best understood by looking at responses to the question: Which candidates would you de nitely not support for the Republican nomination for president?
Steve Deace, an Iowa conservative, said that Trumps behaviour is both a good and a bad thing.
On the other hand, it limits his ability to grow beyond that.
He says, Trump says what theyre thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more they agree with him.
That is certainly the feeling among ordinary supporters who have attended his increasingly packed campaign events recently.
Sometimes life isnt fair.
There have been arguments for years over who is the inventor of the ATM and, in 2005, a man called John Shepherd-Barron received a UK honour as the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser.
But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM  so it seems that, after all the arguments, he now has his place in history.
Back in the mid-1960s, Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and was asked to devise a way to allow customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays.
I wanted to develop a cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identi cation number] and a coded token.
His machine didnt use plastic cards  instead, it used cheques containing carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance.
It is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the worlds  rst to be installed and used by the public; the  rst one, at a bank in north London, was opened on 27 June, 1967  a month before Goodfellows ATM appeared.
However, the patent for Goodfellows machine was lodged on 2 May, 1966, 14 months before Shepherd-Barrons ATM machine was first used.
That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a fuss.
Shepherd-Barron is no longer alive but, in a 2005 interview, he was quite critical of his rival: I dont know him but its clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it.
The website ATMInventor.com says: Who invented the idea of an ATM?
We have to think it was James Goodfellow for holding a patent date of 1966. Who invented the ATM design we recognize today?
We think it was John D White in the US.
So after all these years, Goodfellow is  nally among a group of famous British inventors with John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web).
Asked what he did with the 10 he received in the 1960s, Goodfellow says he thinks he blew it on a night out.
Our new international survey across 33 countries shows how wrong people around the world are about key social realities.
In Britain, people think that 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%.
People also take mental shortcuts, where they take easily available information even if it doesnt quite  t the question.
Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey  and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more wealthy, connected group rather than the general population.
What we  nd throughout the study is that people generalize from their own situations and forget how unrepresentative they are.
For Britain, worries are part of the explanation for peoples huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%).
As part of his series, If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin took on a no-showering challenge to examine the effect of over-cleansing the body.
He reduced the number of showers he had and did not use shampoo or soap when he had a shower.
Showering destroys these bacterial colonies; theyre completely destroyed by all our frequent rubbing and scrubbing.
And, when the bacteria washed off by soap return, they usually favour microbes which produce an odour  yes, showering too often may actually make you smell more.
However, when you stop showering and using soap, your skin goes through an initial (probably gross) adjustment period and, then, after that, the skin typically restores balance, oil production slows and healthy bacteria  ourish.
Reducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleansing products used) has implications for our environment.
Thats 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that were  lling with soap and washing down the drain each day  sometimes more than once.
In a speech at the British Science Festival, Dr Paul Kelley of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students.
In 2014, he published a paper in which he noted that, when children are around ten, their biological wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, someone you may think is just a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am.
The normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds.
A 7am alarm call for older teenagers, Kelley and his colleagues wrote in the paper, is the equivalent of a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.
He says the solution is not to persuade teenagers to go to bed earlier.
Kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms.
Should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am, while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice be encouraged to start at 11am?
Its very uplifting because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.
There would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more alert, he says.
It could mean the end of rush hour as people staggered their work and school-run times.
A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t all people, particularly families.
The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will  nally have regulations on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016.
But even short  ights from a mobile landing pad could cause serious logistical problems, he said.
Theyre not going to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; theyre going to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer, which will probably be an urban area or a suburban area, he said.
In those particular cases, there are going to be hazards that the vehicle is going to have to see.
Then, maybe theres construction equipment that wasnt there before but is there now.
Maybe GPS signals are blocked, in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.
Furthermore, you cant do everything with a 25kg aircraft, said Jay McConville, director of business development for unmanned systems at Lockheed Martin.
He is working on a program to allow drones to inspect infrastructure  pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on.
Weve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it will  y around that area and look at every surface and then report back.
If you  y commercial airlines, they often say, Oh, a component has failed  we have to go back to the gate, Singh said.
Part of the solution, Singh said, is planning for every situation: If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.   
Maria is sitting on a black plastic chair in a community centre on a cold Tuesday afternoon waiting for someone to call her number.
When its her turn, Maria goes to pick up a brown paper bag  lled with essentials including pasta, eggs and corn akes, and can choose between butternut squash or carrots as this weeks vegetables.
Maria is the 34th client so far today at East Hampton Food Pantry, just streets away from some of the most expensive houses in the world.
The Hamptons are historic oceanfront towns and villages 100 miles from Manhattan.
The people who come here are rich and famous but we who live here are not, says Maria, who works 14-hour days in the summer cleaning mansions but often has no work at all in the winter.
She says some families with up to  ve children have to live in basements and still pay more than $1,000 a month in rent.
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if the East Hampton Food Pantry didnt exist, she says.
Vicki Littman is chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry, which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015.
Housing is the biggest cost in the Hamptons.
Cantwell says more than half the towns homes are empty for most of the year  this causes the population to go from 80,000 in August to 10,000 in the winter months.
Youve got to remember that this community used to be a farming and  shing community of people who lived off the land and the water  a real working-class community.
Its hard to grasp  OK, the summer is ending.
Vallone, who works cleaning pools and doing odd jobs on luxury estates, says that, if he saves well, his summer earnings can last until November.
There are worse things to do in life than stroll along Rios Copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a World Cup match, so it was perhaps not surprising that England fan Anthony McDowell from Liverpool was in a good mood.
He and half a dozen friends are among the thousands of supporters from around the world who have made the beach into a party zone of national colours and chants.
Some danced, some posed for photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked football, waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby big screen.
The cheerful, largely peaceful mood was very different from the protests, transport chaos and stadium problems during the preparations for the World Cup.
But, now the football is under way, visiting supporters are determined to enjoy the experience.
The trip has not been without its problems.
And, they have been surprised that many bars do not have big screens for the games.
But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere of this tournament, which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch.
Everyone must have been thrilled by Robin van Persies extraordinary diving header for the Netherlands against Spain.
And, there have been lots of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games  almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010.
The Globo newspaper listed a number of problems in the 12 host cities.
The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers were on strike.
But, protests have diminished since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities and police used tear gas and pepper spray.
The tournament has made only a small mark on Sa_o Paulo, South Americas most populous city, but far away in Manaus  the remote Amazonian city where England played Italy  visitors said there was World Cup fever with brightly decorated streets and  ags on many cars.
But we were in Sao Paulo for four or five days before the opening match and you wouldn't have known until the last day that there was even a World Cup on.
McDonalds is the worlds biggest burger chain and a global emblem of American consumer capitalism.
McDonalds has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% from 2013.
In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because of problems in Ukraine and the anti-western mood in Russia.
But it is in the US, where McDonalds has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis is deepest.
Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his  rst restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.
McDonalds has seen 12 straight months of falling sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter.
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.
McDonalds is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, with its antibiotic-free meat and locally sourced, seasonal produce  although local can mean 350 miles away.
was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website  this refers to the controversial beef  ller used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it  t for human consumption.
Yet, just as McDonalds has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food they think is fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast-food essentials: speedy service at low prices.
The expensive tag was unjusti ed, said Mary Chapman at food analysts Technomic.
A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free wi-  have given McDonalds a broad appeal in the UK, said consultant Peter Martin, adding that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonalds restaurant at least once in the last six months.
Executives are promising to fight misconceptions about its food in its home market.
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger, he said.
Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of 2014, it expects to have 1,400 new restaurants.
We think it will be number one for not just years but decades to come.   
The catching and killing of sharks longer than three metres began after what the state government called an unprecedented number of shark attacks on Western Australias coast.
Kate Faehrmann, of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, said from a protest in the state capital, Perth: Weve always said that this policy wont work.
This has demonstrated something about the national psyche; that, despite all the fear, thousands of people are coming out across the country to say, Thats their ocean.
Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth, said: The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference.
The state government has refused to say how many sharks have been killed, though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines,  oating drums  xed to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks underneath them.
Conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, because no previous cull has only used drumlines.
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state is probably because the state has the fastest-growing population in Australia, not because of a rising number of sharks.
Richard Peirce, of the UK-based conservation charity, the Shark Trust, said that the cull would be ineffective and could bring more predators towards the coast.
People often dont consider that that drumlines are indiscriminate  even if monitored through the day, leaving the lines in at night has the potential to attract other predators into the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.
Worldwide, in 2012, there were 80 attacks by sharks, seven of which were fatal, compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year.
RSPCA Australia said in a statement that it believes the cull is unjusti ed.
Instead, it is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour; that is, there are greater numbers of people in the water, it said.
Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from coming to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it.

Butlers also suffer from isolation, cultural differences with their employer and having to work for people who arent always nice. 
Employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before looking for additional work elsewhere.
And this needs to consider both the advantages and disadvantages for businesses and employees.
Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it was reported that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts.
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of many other companies using the contracts, including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses them for its 350 summer workers.
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff  80% of its workforce  on zero-hours contracts.
Vidhya Alakeson, from the Resolution Foundation, added: If its true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a substantial portion of the workforce  this could no longer be dismissed as an issue affecting only a tiny minority.
Unions and poverty campaign groups have accused employers of pressuring staff into signing the contracts so that they can avoid their responsibilities and reduce staff bene ts.
They may give  exibility to a few, but the contracts favour the employers and make it hard for workers to complain.
Workers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are created, but are expected to be on call for extra work at short notice.
We believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, as we are very weather-dependent, a spokeswoman said.
Its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.
Figures from the poll suggest that 17% of employers in the private sector use zero-hours contracts, considerably lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.
Industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).
